    "question": "What does Big M method mean?",
    "answer": "In operations research, the Big M method is a method of solving linear programming problems using the simplex algorithm. The Big M method extends the simplex algorithm to problems that contain \"greater-than\" constraints. It does so by associating the constraints with large negative constants which would not be part of any optimal solution, if it exists.",

    "answer": "The exploration–exploitation dilemma, also known as the explore–exploit tradeoff, is a fundamental concept in decision-making that arises in many domains. It is depicted as the balancing act between two opposing strategies. Exploitation involves choosing the best option based on current knowledge of the system (which may be incomplete or misleading), while exploration involves trying out new options that may lead to better outcomes in the future at the expense of an exploitation opportunity.",

Many training algorithms, such as backpropagation, have an inherent susceptibility to getting \"stuck\" in local minima or maxima of the response function. ALOPEX uses a cross-correlation of differences and a stochastic process to overcome this in an attempt to reach the absolute minimum (or maximum) of the response function.",

However, it doesn't have to be! Since the number of possible one-hot vectors is only size_of_vocabulary, then y could just be a num_of_training_sequences sized array that contains references (aka pointers) to pre-allocated one-hot vectors. This way, if two sequences end in the same word and should have the same one-hot vector, then they would just reference the same address in memory of that one-hot vector. \nAnd everyone should be happy, except from numpy arrays. Because when I cast this magesticly efficient data structure to numpy array, it tries to allocate the whole array into memory, along with duplicate and reduntant one-hot vectors. \nIs there anything I can do to overcome this?

Because one-hot vector arrays contain a lot of zeros, they are sparse and it is much more efficient to store them as such e.g. with scipy's sparse matrix implementations. The generator function will again need to convert them to dense numpy arrays for fit_generator().\nThere is also a sparse tensor implemented in tf that should not require a generator to convert it to a dense array but I wasn't able to make it work.",

    "answer": "Non-convex optimization deals with optimizing  functions that are not convex. Unlike their convex counterparts, minimizing non-convex functions can lead to local minima, making finding the global minimum a more challenging task.  Non-convex optimization is prevalent in various disciplines, including machine learning, signal processing, and engineering design. Real-world examples include training deep neural networks, solving inverse problems like image reconstruction, and optimizing portfolios in finance. \n\nHistorically, the development of non-convex optimization has been driven by the increasing complexity of real-world problems and the availability of powerful computational resources. Future trends in non-convex optimization include the development of more efficient and robust algorithms, as well as the integration with machine learning techniques for data-driven optimization. Advanced techniques and strategies in non-convex optimization involve leveraging properties such as strong convexity and smoothness, incorporating stochastic optimization methods, and employing specialized algorithms like alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).",

I also have a reward function.\nRight now I am using simulated annealing, where I randomly move a qubit or swap two qubits.\nHowever, this ansatz is not working well for more than 30 qubits.\nThat's why I thought to use a policy, which tells me which qubit to move/swap instead of doing it randomly.\nReading the gym documentation, I couldn't find what option I should use. I don't need Q-Learning or deep reinforcement learning as far as I understood since I only need to learn a policy?\nI would also be fine using Pytorch or whatever.

    "answer": "There are two categories of RL algorithms.\nOne category like Q-learning, Deep Q-learning and other ones learn a value function that for a state and an action predicts the estimated reward that you will get. Then, once you know for each state and each action what the reward is, your policy is simply to select for each state the action that provides the biggest reward. Thus, in the case of these algorithms, even if you learn a value function, the policy depends on this value function.\nThen, you have other deep rl algorithms where you learn a policy directly, like Reinforce, Actor Critic algorithms or other ones. You still learn a value function, but at the same time you also learn a policy with the help of the value function. The value function will help the system learn the policy during training, but during testing you do not use the value function anymore, but only the policy.\nThus, in the first case, you actually learn a value function and act greedy on this value function, and in the second case you learn a value function and a policy and then you use the policy to navigate in the environment.\nIn the end, both these algorithms should work for your problem, and if you say that you are new to RL, maybe you could try the Deep Q-learning from the gym documentation.",

    "answer": "**Innovations and Cutting-Edge Research in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**\n\n**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**\n\nGANs have revolutionized image and video generation. They consist of two neural networks: a generator that creates new data and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and generated data. GANs are used for tasks such as photorealistic image synthesis, super-resolution, and image editing.\n\n**Transformer Networks:**\n\nTransformers have gained popularity in natural language processing and have recently been adapted for computer vision tasks. They use self-attention mechanisms to model relationships between image features, enabling more accurate and efficient object detection and segmentation.\n\n**Capsule Networks:**\n\nCapsule networks aim to address the limitations of traditional CNNs in modeling spatial relationships and object hierarchies. They utilize capsule layers that encapsulate both positional and feature information, resulting in improved performance on tasks like object recognition and pose estimation.\n\n**Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs):**\n\nGCNs extend CNNs to non-Euclidean data, such as graphs. They have shown promise in processing social networks, molecular structures, and other complex data types for tasks such as graph classification and node embedding.\n\n**Few-Shot Learning:**\n\nFew-shot learning algorithms enable CNNs to learn from a limited number of labeled examples. This is crucial for tasks where acquiring sufficient labeled data is challenging. Meta-learning and transfer learning techniques are utilized in few-shot learning approaches.\n\n**Edge Computing and On-Device CNNs:**\n\nThe deployment of CNNs on edge devices and smartphones has become possible due to advances in hardware and optimization techniques. On-device CNNs enable real-time and low-latency applications such as object detection, facial recognition, and image enhancement.\n\n**Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI):**\n\nXAI methods provide insights into how CNNs make decisions. This is crucial for building trust and interpretability in CNN-based systems. Techniques such as saliency maps, gradient-based explanations, and counterfactual analysis help explain model predictions and identify potential biases or weaknesses.\n\nResearch in CNNs continues to push the boundaries of computer vision, with promising applications in various domains, including healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and manufacturing.",

In general, as the number of tunable parameters in a model increase, it becomes more flexible, and can better fit a training data set. That is, the model has lower error or lower bias.",

    "answer": "By calling repartition(N) spark will do a shuffle to change the number of partitions (and will by default result in a HashPartitioner with that number of partitions). When you call sc.parallelize with a desired number of partitions it splits your data (more or less) equally up amongst the slices (effectively similar to a range partitioner), you can see this in ParallelCollectionRDD inside of the slice function.\nThat being said, it is possible that both of these sc.parallelize(data, N) and rdd.reparitition(N) (and really almost any form of reading in data) can result in RDDs with empty partitions (its a pretty common source of errors with mapPartitions code so I biased the RDD generator in spark-testing-base to create RDDs with empty partitions). A really simple fix for most functions is just checking if you've been passed in an empty iterator and just returning an empty iterator in that case.",

This will import the same function from the correct module.\nOption 2: Wait for pandas-datareader to update --You can also wait for the library to be upgraded to import correctly and then run pip3 install --upgrade pandas-datareader. You can go to the Github repo for pandas-datareader and raise an issue.\nOption 3: Ignore it -- Just ignore the warning for now since it doesn't break your program.",

I can see that I need to then sum the same lon and lat values in area_array that have a value that isn't zero in total_combustion_rate and that should give me the total area of grid squares that were on fire.\nConverting to a percentage should then just be: (total on fire / total area contained in area_array) * 100.\nI'm totally lost on how I'd go about doing this though as I get a bit confused with 3D numpy arrays.

    "answer": "I am assuming numpy is imported under the name np, and all arrays are numpy arrays.\nYou have to start by summing total_combustion_rate along the time dimension.

    "answer": "The amount of pre-fetching depends on your queue capacity. If you use string_input_producer for your filenames and batch for batching, you will have 2 queues - filename queue, and prefetching queue created by batch. Queue created by batch has default capacity of 32, controlled by batch(...,capacity=) argument, therefore it can prefetch up to 32 images. If you follow outline in TensorFlow official howto's, processing examples (everything after batch) will happen in main Python thread, whereas filling up the queue will happen in threads created/started by batch/start_queue_runners, so prefetching new data and running prefetched data through the network will occur concurrently, blocking when the queue gets full or empty.",

    "question": "I am collecting time series data, which can be separated into \"tasks\" based on a particular target value. These tasks can be numbered based on the associated target. However, the lengths of data associated with each task will differ because it may take less time or more time for a \"task\" to be completed. Right now in MATLAB, this data is separated by the target number into a MATLAB cell, which is extremely convenient as the analysis on this time-series data will be the same for each set of data associated with each target, and thus I can complete data analysis simply by using a for loop to go through each cell in the cell array. My knowledge on the closest equivalent of this in Python would be to generate a ragged array. However, through my research on answering this question, I have found that automatic setting of a ragged array has been deprecated, and that if you want to generate a ragged array you must set dtype = object. I have a few questions surrounding this scenario:\n\nDoes setting dtype=object for the ragged array come with any inherent limitations on how one will access the data within the array?\n\nIs there a more convenient way of saving these ragged arrays as numpy files besides reducing dimensionality from 3D to 2D and also saving a file of the associated index? This would be fairly inconvenient I think as I have thousands of files for which it would be convenient to save as a ragged array.\n\nRelated to 2, is saving the data as a .npz file any different in practice in terms of saving an associated index? More specifically, would I be able to unpack the ragged arrays automatically based on a technically separate .npy file for each one and being able to assume that each set of data associated with each target is stored in the same way for every file?\n\nMost importantly, is using ragged arrays really the best equivalent set-up for my task, or do I get the deprecation warning about setting dtype=object because manipulating data in this way has become redundant and Python3 has a better method for dealing with stacked arrays of varying size?",
    "answer": "I have decided to move forward with a known solution to my problem, and it seems to be adapting well.\nI organize each set of separate data into it's own array, and then store them in a sequence in a list as I would with cells in MATLAB.\nTo save this information, when I separated out the data I stored the subsequent index value in a list. By this I mean that:\n\nI identify the location of the next separate set of data.\nI copy the data up until that index value into an array that is appended to a list.\nI store the index value that was the start of the next separate set of data.\nI delete that information from a copy of my original array.\nI repeat steps 1-4 until there is only one uniquely labelled sequence of data left. I append this set of data. There is no other index to record. Therefore the list of indices is equal to the length of the list of arrays -1.\nWhen saving data, I take the original array and save it in a .npz file with the unpacking indices.\nWhen I want to use and reload the data into it's separate arrays for analysis, I can 'pack' and 'unpack' the array into it's two different forms, from single numpy array to list of numpy arrays.\n\nThis solution is working quite well.

Now once trained my box model on the wiki corpus txt i notice that calling the \"most similar\" function that i create appositely for box embedding prints very often stop words, instead the same word passed to the most similar function of word2vec model trained on the same corpus txt produce best results. Can someone suggest me why Word2vec model fit so well despite the corpus txt have a lot of stop words instead my box model on the same corpus not?",
    "answer": "How did you train a box-embedding, and why did you think it would offer good most_similar() results?\nFrom a (very) quick glance at the 'BoxE' paper by Abboud et al (2020), it appears to require training based on a knowledge base representation – not the raw text that'd come from WikiCorpus. (So I'd not necessarily expect a properly-trained BoxE embedding would have 'stop words' in it at all.)\nAnd, BoxE appears to be optimized for evaluating potential facts – not more general most_similar rankings. So I'd not expect a simple most_similar listing from it to necessarily be expressive.\nIn usual word2vec, removing stop-words isn't very important and plenty of published work doesn't bother doing so. The downsampling of highly-frequent words already tends to ignore many stop-word occurrences – and their highly diverse usage contexts mean they are likely to get weak word-vectors not especially close to other more-narrow-meaning word-vectors.\nSo in usual word2vec, stop-words  aren't very likely to be in the top-neighbors, by cosine-similarity, of other more-specific entity words.",

I assume, therefore, that it is some sort of stock message.\nIn any case, I can't figure out what the heck it means.  Is this useful information?  Note that, being \"outside\" of the class, so to speak, I never have access to self.  Furthermore, it is impossible to instantiate a class if I cannot access the signature of the __init__ method, and can therefore not even do help(type(my_object_instantiated)).  Its a catch 22.  In order to use __init__, I need the signature for __init__, but in order to read the signature for __init__, I need to instantiate an object with __init__.  This point is strictly academic however, for even when I do manage to instantiate a scipy.stats.binom, it actually returns an object of an entirely different class, rv_frozen, with the exact same message in its __init__ docstring, but whose signature is entirely different and entirely less useful.  In other words, help(type(self)) actually does not give an accurate signature.  It is useless.\nDoes anyone know where this message comes from, or what I'm supposed to make of it?  Is it just stock rubbish from a documentation generator, or am I user-erroring?",
    "answer": "There is a convention that the signature for constructing a class instance is put in the __doc__ on the class (since that is what the user calls) rather than on __init__ (or __new__) which determines that signature.  This is especially true for extension types (written in C) whose __init__ cannot have its signature discovered via introspection.\nThe message that you see is part of the type class (see help(type.__init__)) and is thus inherited by metaclasses by default.\nIn some versions, scipy.stats.binom confuses the matter by not actually being a type; it is merely an instance of another class that (like type) is callable.  So asking for help on it merely gives the help for that class (just like help(1) gets you help(int))—you have to look at its __call__ for further information (if any).  And asking for help on the result of calling it gives you help for the actual class of whatever it returns, as you observed.",

    "answer": "Those numbers are learned vectors that each represents a dimension that best separates each word from each other, given some limiting number of dimensions (normally ~200). So if one group of words tends to appear in the same context, then they'd likely share a similar score on one or more dimensions. \nFor example, words like North, South, East, West are likely to be very close since they are interchangeable in many contexts. \nThe dimensions are chosen by algorithm to maximize the variance they encode, and what they mean is not necessarily something we can talk about in words. But imagine a bag of fridge-magnets each representing a letter of the alphabet - if you shine a light on them so as to cast a shadow, there will be some orientations of the letters that yield more discriminatory information in the shadows than for other orientations. \nThe dimensions in a word-embedding represent the best \"orientations\" that give light to the most discriminatory \"shadows\". Sometimes these dimensions might approximate things we recognise as having direct meaning, but very often, they wont.\nThat being said, if you collect words that do have similar functions, and find the vectors from those words to other words that are the endpoint of some kind of fixed relationship - say England, France, Germany as one set of words consisting of Countries, and London, Paris, Berlin as another set of words consisting of the respective Capital-Cities, you will find that the relative vectors between each country and its capital are often very, very similar in both direction and magnitude. \nThis has an application for search because you can start with a new word location, say \"Argentina\" and by looking in the location arrived at by applying the relative \"has_capital_city\" vector, you should arrive at the word \"Buenos Aires\".\nSo the raw dimensions probably have little meaning of their own, but by performing these A is to B as X is to Y comparisons, it is possible to derive relative vectors that do have a meaning of sorts.",

I am sure there are ways to do this but I cannot find the way.

    "answer": "There are several reasons for a NaN loss and why models diverge. Most common ones I've seen are:\n\nYour learning rate is too high. If this is the case, the loss increases and then diverges to infinity.\nYou are getting a division by zero error. If this is the case, you can add a small number like 1e-8 to your output probability.\nYou have bad inputs. If this is the case, make sure that you do not feed your model with NaNs. i.e. use assert not np.any(np.isnan(x)) on the input data.\nYour labels are not in the same domain of your objective function. If this is the case, check the range of your labels and make sure they match.\n\nIf none of the above helps, try to check the activation function, the optimizer, the loss function, the size and the shape of the network.\nFinally, though less likely, there might be a bug with the framework you are using. Check the repo of the framework if there are others having the same issue.",

    "question": "Premise\nI am working on a private project in python using numpy. My program works with hexagons, which edges have certain features.\nI currently represent these hexagons by numpy arrays with one entry for each edge.\nThere is a need to compare hexagons for equality, which is special because some differentiable features are considered equal. Also hexagons should be equal if they are the same just in another rotation (numpy array is barrel-rolled by some amount).\nTo solve the first problem, edges are represented by bytes, each bit marking an \"equal\" feature. Now two edges can simply be compared by bitwise_and and any value non zero prooves equality.\nTo solve the second problem equality is checked by comparing all six rotations of a hex aginst the other hex.\nAll arrays I describe here are of dtype=uint8, so 255 is the neutral element for bitwise_and.\nProblem\nEach arrangement of a hexagon has a value associated with it. What I mean by arrangement is how features of the hexagon are arranged, for example two adjacent edges have one feature, the other four an other. The specific features dont matter for this value. So the hex [4, 4, 2, 8, 8, 8] has the same value associated with it as hex [2, 4, 4, 1, 2, 2] (notice rotation by one and substitution of values).\nAdditionally edges can have \"don't care\" as a feature (represented by all ones in binary to make the equality check work as intended). In that case I need to find the associated values of all compatible hexagons, no matter the feature of that particular edge.\nWhat I need is a clever representation of these \"meta\"-hexagons, which just care about arrangement not type of features.\nI then need a way for a given hexagon to find all meta-hexagons that could describe its arrangement.\nIdeas\nOne idea is to represent the meta-hexes like every other hexagon, using numbers to differentiate each unique feature. A meta-hex like [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2] would need to match any hex [x, x, y, x, y, y].\nHow to find all meta-hexes for a given hexagon with \"dont care\"-edges?\nA: One possibility would be to create all possible meta-hexagons for a given hexagon. The problem with this approach is that the number of possibilities can be quite large. For example, a common hexagon in my application is one with five adjacent \"don't care\"-edges (only one important feature). The number of features is only about 5 (it's actually more, but some features are mutually exclusive so 5 independent features is a good approximation) but even then 5^5=3125 (minus a couple because of equality under rotation) seems quite a lot. The advantage of this approach would be that I don't need any equality checks against the meta-hexes and could use a dictionary to access the values (for example using the numpy bytes as key).\nB: Another possibility would be to save the meta-hexes in a numpy array, which allows fast comparisons against all meta-hexes at once. In that case one could leave \"don't care\"-edges as they were (all bits one) and would only need to transform the given features into meta-hex representation. So [2, 8, 8, 255, 255, 255] would become something like [1, 2, 2, 255, 255, 255] and comparison could be done with bitwise_and and a nonzero check again to make the \"dont care\" edges match anything. The problem in this case is that the hexagon wouldn't match meta-hexes like [2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1] where the features are simply numbered differently, even though it should. So all possible numbering schemes and rotations would have to be created. Even with rules such that numbers are increased by one from one feature to the next, it would be a couple dozen possible representations.\nQuestions\n\nIn general, is there a way to represent polygons so that two polygons with different rotations but otherwise equal, can be identified as such without having to compare all possible rotations?\n\nWhich numpy functions should I look into to implement my idea in A. Replacing all \"dont cares\" with all possible features sounds like permutations to me?\n\nFor my approach in B, is there a way to further reduce the amount of hexagons I have to create?\n\n\nAny help is appreciated, I've thought about this for three days now, going back and forth in my head. So even remotely related links and reading material or just keywords to lookup and/or add to the tags of this question are happily received.\nAlso I'm new here, so any tips regarding stack overflow are welcome!\nIf you've read this far, thank you for your time!",
    "answer": "It seems like you are chasing performance here... I'll answer some of the questions keeping that in mind but be warned: premature optimization is always a bad idea. If it is optimization you are looking for it is almost always best to write any solution and then take it from there.\nIn general you can win in terms of time complexity if you are willing to deal with a bit of extra memory.\n\nFor each hexagon create a copy of it but permuted such that the smallest \"edge\" is first. This has a little bit of startup cost and a bit of extra memory but then the comparison is easy as you only need to compare one array. (if the smallest element is repeated you can come up with some heuristic to create a unique order)\n\n2.3. I would create \"mask\" arrays that each hexagon has. This mask array is then used by your comparison function to decide what comparison rules to check for. If you just want code neatness then this just means creating a hexagon object which contains all these extra arrays and then overloading the __eq__property.\nIf you want all this to be fast then you probably have no choice but to implement this \"comparison\" operation in C and then having your python code call it.",

    "question": "I am using ubuntu 20.04. I created a new environment.\nconda create -n tfgpu python=3.8\nconda activate tfgpu\npip install tensorflow-gpu==2.3\njupyter notebook\nThen I open a previously created .ipynb file and I try to import tensorflow.\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.version\nversion is coming out to be 2.4.1\nI had an installation of tensorflow 2.4.1 in my base environment. Even if it is unrelated, I uninstalled that. I checked for tf 2.4.1 in other environment too but could not find any. When I write !pip uninstall tensorflow in that notebook, it says Skipping as no tensorflow installed. When I write !pip uninstall tensorflow-gpu, it uninstalled tensorflow==2.3. And after that it was still able to import tensorflow which was 2.4.1 version. I do not understand what is happening. I can say that I once also installed tf-nightly but was in a different environment. I am thinking it is something related to path of installation or does it have anything to do with environment name.

    "answer": "MatchIt has several options to accomplish this. Here are a few:\n\nPair matching with a caliper (i.e., method = \"nearest\" or \"genetic\" and caliper specified). Only the closest units will be paired, leaving the unpaired units out of the final analysis. This reduces your sample size but restricts the sample to a region with a good overlap and often good resulting covariate balance but changes the estimand to one unspecified.\n\nPair matching with replacement (i.e., method = \"nearest\" or \"genetic\" and replace = TRUE). Each treated unit will be matched to a control unit, but control units can be reused, so it doesn't matter how many there are. Matching with replacement can also be used when there are more treated than control units. If no caliper is used, this method retains the ATT as the target estimand.\n\nFull matching (i.e., method = \"full\"). This forms subclasses of all units in an optimal way and then produces matching weights. No units are discarded, and it doesn't matter how many units of each treatment group there are. Any estimand can be validly targeted with this method.\n\n\nMake sure you read the MatchIt vignettes to understand these methods and how to estimate effects using them. They are all explained in detail.\nIf none of these methods are giving you balance, you might just have an inherently imbalanced sample. Weighting methods (available in the WeightIt package) might be a good alternative. You should try many methods of matching and weighting to find the one that yields the best balance while retaining precision and the target estimand (if desired).",

I did a little bit of the backend's work in my main script, setting up a RendererPdf (defined in backend_pdf.py) and conatining a GraphicsContextPdf which is a GraphicsContextBase which keeps a capstyle, intialized as butt. As confirmed by grep, this is the only place where butt is hardcoded as a capstyle. After some ipython debugging, I've found that a new GraphicsContextPdf or 'gc' is generated each time a patch is drawn (c.f. patches.py:392, called by way of a necessary fig.draw() in the main script), and the settings for the new gc (again initialized as butt) are incorporated into the original RendererPdf's gc.

I want to find tiny clusters where there are semantical and textual duplicates.\nTo do this I am using gensim to generate document vectors. The elements of the resulting docvecs are all in the range [-1,1].\nTo compare two documents I want to compare the angular similarity. I do this by calculating the cosine similarity of the vectors, which works fine. \nBut, to cluster the documents HDBSCAN requires a distance matrix, and not a similarity matrix. The native conversion from cosine similarity to cosine distance in sklearn is 1-similarity. However, it is my understanding that using this formula can break the triangle inequality preventing it from being a true distance metric. When searching and looking at other people's code for similar tasks, it seems that most people seem to be using sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances(data, metric='cosine') which is defines cosine distance as 1-similarity anyway. It looks like it provides appropriate results.\nI am wondering if this is correct, or if I should use angular distance instead, calculated as np.arccos(cosine similarity)/pi. I have also seen people use Euclidean distance on l2-normalized document vectors; this seems to be equivalent to cosine similarity.\nPlease let me know what is the most appropriate method for calculating distance between document vectors for clustering :)",

And you should exactly use what was trained.\nPeople use the cosine all the time because it worked well for bag of words. The choice is not based on a proper theoretical analysis for all I know.\nHDBSCAN does not require a metric. The 1-sim transformation assumes that x is bounded by 1, so that won't reliably work.\nI suggest to try the following approaches:\n\nuse negative distances. That may simply work. I.e., d(x,y)=-(x dot y)\nuse max-sim transformation. Once you have the dot product matrix it is easy to get the maximum value.\nimplement HDBSCAN* with a similarity rather than a metric",

If there is one, using the unsorted graph is much better.\nI thought about using threads/multiprocessing, so that both graphs are explored at the same time and once one finds an answer (no solution or a specific solution), the other one stops and we go to the next step or end the algorithm. This didn't work, it just makes the process much slower (even though I would expect it to just double the time required for each step, compared to using the optimal graph without threads/multiprocessing).\nI don't know why this didn't work and wonder if there is a better way, that maybe doesn't even required the use of threads/multiprocessing, any clue?",

The keyword here is \"robustly\": the algorithm tries really hard to identify a large (ideally, the largest) set of matching keypoints that are acceptable, in the sense they agree with each other on supporting a particular value of the model. \nThis is done because matched pair of keypoints may be \"wrong\", either because the matching algorithm screws up (think left eye matched to right eye), or because the matching is correct, but it does not conform to the model (think matches on the same point of a moving car when the two images are taken some time apart). These wrong matches, or \"outliers\", can (and usually do) throw off the model estimate when the estimation procedure is not robust.",

    "question": "My goal is to apply GA to find optimum locations to place a number of circles (equal dia) in a 2D plane such that no two circles are closer than a certain distance. I account for the proximity constrain by setting the fitness function to -1 if the constraint is broken but the problem is none of the initial population randomly generated follows the proximity constraint thus making the fitness of all the members -1.\nBy googling, I found that if the plane is separated in to grids with the size of clearance I won't have this problem, but I'm afraid it will miss a lot of potential solution. Is there a method to incorporate the proximity constraint or should I go with the grid?",
    "answer": "Instead of just random, start with a random solution with constraints. Generate one circle, then find the feasible space for next circle, create second circle and continue until you generate entire generation.",

I have a heavily skewed dataset in the order of { 'Class 0': 0.987, 'Class 1':0.012 }\nI would like to have a set of classifiers that work well on such datasets and then create an ensemble learner of those models. I do not think I want to oversample or undersample. I definitely dont want to SMOTE because they don't scale well for high dimensional data/ or result in a very large number of data points. I want to use a cost sensitive approach to creating my classifiers and hence came across the class_weight=balanced parameter in the scikit-learn library. However, it doesn't seem to be helping me much because my F1 scores are still very terrible (in the range of 0.02 etc.) I have also tried using sklearn.utils.class_weight.compute_class_weight to manually calculate the weights, store them in a dictionary and pass it as a parameter to the class_weight parameter, however I see no improvement in F1 score and my False Positives are still very high(around 5k) and everything else quite low(less than 50). I don't understand what I am missing. Am I implementing something wrong? What else can I do to tackle my problem? When I change my evaluation metric from f1_score(average='binary') to f1_score(average='weighted') the F1 score increases from ~0.02 to ~98.66, which I think is probably wrong.

    "answer": "Here's a simple explanation of why it's not a good idea to shuffle data when working with time series:\nImagine that you have a bunch of data points that represent things that happened over time. Each data point has a time stamp, like a date, that tells you when it happened.\nNow, imagine that you mix up all of the data points and put them in a different order. This is like shuffling a deck of cards. It might seem like a good idea because it helps you check if your model is working well, but it's actually not a good idea because the order of the data points is important.\nThe data points are like a story, and the order they happened in is important to understanding the story. If you shuffle the data points, it's like telling the story out of order, and it doesn't make sense anymore. It's hard for your model to learn from the data if the data doesn't make sense.\nSo, when you're working with time series data, it's important to keep the data points in the order that they happened.

Python is really behind Ruby (bundler!) when it comes to dealing with installing and keeping track of modules. The best tool you have is virtualenv.\nSo I suggest you create a virtualenv directory for each of your applications, put together a file where you list all the 'pip install' commands you need to build the environment and ensure that you have a clean repeatable process for creating this environment.\nI think that the nature of the application makes little difference. There should not be any performance issue since all that virtualenv does is to load libraries from a specific path rather than load them from the directory where they are saved by default.\nIn any case (this may be completely irrelevant), but if performance is an issue, then perhaps you ought to be looking at a compiled language.

    "answer": "There are different ways to implement multiple meteorological stations in a machine learning model depending on the specific problem you are trying to solve and the characteristics of the data. Here are a few options to consider:\n\nIndependent models: One option is to train a separate model for each meteorological station, using the data for that station as input. This approach is useful if the stations have different characteristics or if you want to make predictions for each station independently.\n\nCombined model: Another option is to combine the data from all stations and train a single model to make predictions for all of them at once. This approach is useful if the stations are similar and the relationship between the input variables and the output variable is the same across all stations.\n\nMulti-task learning: You can also consider using multi-task learning, where you train a single model to perform multiple tasks, one for each meteorological station. This approach is useful if the stations are similar but have different characteristics and you want to make predictions for all of them at once.\n\n\nRegarding how to combine the predictions, it depends on the problem you are trying to solve. If you want to make a prediction for each station independently you don't need to combine the predictions. But if you want to make a prediction for all the stations you can use an ensemble method like a majority vote or a weighted average to combine the predictions.\nYou can find more information about these approaches and examples of their implementation in papers and tutorials about multi-task learning, multi-output regression and ensemble methods.\nAlso, it might be helpful to explore the correlation between the meteorological stations. You can use the correlation matrix and heatmap to explore the correlation between the different meteorological stations. If they are highly correlated you can combine them in a single model, otherwise, you can consider them as independent inputs.",

    "answer": "In CSV, the fundamental, non-splittable chunk of data is one row, usually the bytes between one \\n character and the subsequent one. This bytes chunk size is typically small. When you load data with dask, it reads from a given offset to the next \\n to be able to read an exact number of rows. You would find, if you made the chunk size too small, that some partitions would contain no data.\nParquet is not structured like this. Its fundamental non-splittable chunk is the \"row-group\", and there is often just one row group per data file. This is done for efficiency: encoding and compressing a whole row group's worth of data in one block will give maximum read throughput. Furthermore, because of the encoding and compression, it's much harder for dask to guess how big a piece of a dataset will be as an in-memory pandas dataframe, but it can be many times bigger.\nA row group could easily be >>100MB in size. In fact, this is generally recommended, as smaller pieces will have a higher fraction of their processing time in overhead and latency.\nTo summarize\n\ndask will not split a parquet dataset beyond the partitioning within the data files\nthat partition size might be many times larger in memory than on disk, so repartitioning after load may result in many partitions\nthese are tradeoffs required to make parquet as fast and space-efficient as it is",

But both of the parameters here are the output values, and it doesn't seem that it involves any of the indepent variables. Could you help me to understand how this is calculated?",
    "answer": "You asked about the python code x = r2_score(y_true, y_pred)\nNote that:\n\n\n\n\ny_pred\ny_true\n\n\n\n\ny_pred stands for \"prediction of the y-variable\"\ny_true stands for \"true value of the y-variable\"\n\n\nThe predicted value is never the raw data. Often times, the predicted value is a line of best fit.\ny_true are the raw numbers you collect during either an experiment, survey, or scientific study.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that you have a model of a teenagers height as a function of age.\n\n\n\n\nAGE (years since birth)\n10 years\n12 years\n14 years\n16 years\n\n\n\n\nHIEGHT (inches)\n55\n60\n65\n68\n\n\n\n\nAGE is defined as years since birth (not years since conception, like in China).\nAlso, we round age down to the nearest whole year.\nA child 10.81773 years old is listed as 10 years old.\nAn example of a predicted value might be that you think, on average, a child 10 years of age is 55 inches tall.\nIf you conduct a study where you measure the height of 1,038 children who are each 10 years old, you will find that the children are not all exactly 55 inches tall.\nThe raw data (measured heights of children) is known as the set of true y-values.\nStatisticians often measure error by comparing the distance from the measured height of a child from the predicted height.\nFor example, 10-year-old Joanna's height is 52 inches (rounded to the nearest whole inch).\nWe predicted Joanna's height to be 55 inches.\nThere are 3 inches of difference between the true, and the predicted, values.\nOften times, statisticians want one number for a data set, instead of 1,038 different numbers.\nOne thing you can do is convert the difference between the predicted height, and the actual heights of the children, into a positive number. For example, -5 becomes +5\nAfter that, compute the average positive-difference (in inches) between actual height and predicted height.\nTaking the absolute difference is important. Some children are shorter than predicted (-2 inches), and some children are taller (+7 inches).\nIf you allow negative numbers the average difference between the average height and actual height will always be zero.\n\nTake 1,038 actual heights.\nsubtract 55 inches from the actual height.\nsum up the height discrepancies without converting to positive numbers\nthe result will always be zero.\n\nIn fact, one way to define mean is that the mean of a sequence of numbers is a number x such that when you calculate the difference between each data-point and x, then sum the results, the answer is zero.\nGenerally, statisticians square the differences.\nSince Joanna was short  (-2 inches) the squared error for Joanna is +4 inches.\nA negative number times a negative number is always a positive number.\nSquaring gets rid of the negative signs.\nTaking the absolute value gets rid of the negative signs.\nActually... there are about a million ways to get rid of the negative signs.\nSome statistician's are like the parrots in the 1998 movie \"Paulie.\"\nI say \"taco\" and they say \"TACO! TACO! TACO!\"\nThey copy what other statisticians do, and it never occurs to them that there is more than one way to do statistical analysis.\nI have a degree in math, I have seen proofs that the curve which minimizes the mean-squared-error is ideal in some ways.\nHowever, the mean-squared-error is more of a heuristic, or proxy, than a measure of what really, truly, matters.\nNobody actually has a formula which perfectly computes for data-set A, and data-set B, which data-set is more \"spread-out\" than the other.\nIt is difficult to tell what humans care about.\nAnyways, mean-square-error is better than nothing. IT measures how spread-out a data-set is. A\nre the data-points WAY WAY far away from the average, or all pretty close to the average?\nWhat-if 55 inches was the true average height of a 10-year-old child?\nAlso imagine \"what-if\" the true standard deviation was 4 inches.\nIn that imaginary world, suppose you randomly sampled 1,038 children, each 10 years of age.\nYour sample-variance (computed from experimental data) is 7.1091 inches.\nWhat is the likelihood that a sample of 1,038 children would have a variance of 7.1091 inches or more?\nIf your model is correct, what is the likelihood that the data would as far, or further, from the model's prediction as that you observed?\nIf the data you see is way WAY WAY far away from the predicted value, then your model is probably bad.\nAnyway the R-squared measure is:\n\n0% if the data does not match the model at all\n100% if the differences between the data and the prediction are adequately explained by random chance.\n\nFor example, if you toss a fair-coin 1,000 times, it is reasonably that 491 results would be heads instead of exactly 500 results of \"heads\".\nThe question is, is the observed value (491 heads out of 1,000 tosses) likely, or extremely weird, given the model which says that it should be about 500 out of 1,000.",

This performed well on Test Set 1, which only has images of class A and B.\nI wanted to add several classes to the model, so I constructed a separate dataset, Training Data 2 (about 300 images). This dataset contains labeled data for class B, and new classes C, D and E. However it does NOT include data for class A. Upon training the model on this data, it performed well on Test Set 2 which contained only images of B, C, D and E (however the accuracy on B did not go up despite extra data)\nConcerned, I checked the accuracy of the model on Test Set 1 again, and as I had assumed, the model didn't recognize class A at all. In this case I'm assuming I didn't actually refine the model but instead retrained the model completely.\nMy Question: Am I correct in assuming I cannot refine the model on a completely separate set of data, and instead if I want to add more classes to my trained model that I must combine Training Set 1 and Training Set 2 and train on the entirety of the data?\nThank you!",
    "answer": "It mostly depends on your hyperparameters, namely, your learning rate and the number of epochs trained. Higher learning rates will make the model forget the old data faster. Also, be sure not to be overfitting your data, have a validation set as well. Models that have overfit the training data tend to be very sensitive to weight (and data) perturbations.\nTLDR. If not trained on all data, ML models tend to forget old data in favor of new data.",

    "question": "I am taking intro to ML on Coursera offered by Duke, which I recommend if you are interested in ML. The instructors of this course explained that \"We typically include nonlinearities between layers of a neural network.There's a number of reasons to do so.For one, without anything nonlinear between them, successive linear transforms (fully connected layers) collapse into a single linear transform, which means the model isn't any more expressive than a single layer. On the other hand, intermediate nonlinearities prevent this collapse, allowing neural networks to approximate more complex functions.\" I am curious that, if I apply ReLU, aren't we losing information since ReLU is transforming every negative value to 0? Then how is this transformation more expressive than that without ReLU?\nIn Multilayer Perceptron, I tried to run MLP on MNIST dataset without a ReLU transformation, and it seems that the performance didn't change much (92% with ReLU and 90% without ReLU). But still, I am curious why this tranformation gives us more information rather than lose information.",
    "answer": "the first point is that without nonlinearities, such as the ReLU function, in a neural network, the network is limited to performing linear combinations of the input. In other words, the network can only learn linear relationships between the input and output. This means that the network can't approximate complex functions that are not linear, such as polynomials or non-linear equations.\nConsider a simple example where the task is to classify a 2D data point as belonging to one of two classes based on its coordinates (x, y). A linear classifier, such as a single-layer perceptron, can only draw a straight line to separate the two classes. However, if the data points are not linearly separable, a linear classifier will not be able to classify them accurately. A nonlinear classifier, such as a multi-layer perceptron with a nonlinear activation function, can draw a curved decision boundary and separate the two classes more accurately.\nReLU function increases the complexity of the neural network by introducing non-linearity, which allows the network to learn more complex representations of the data. The ReLU function is defined as f(x) = max(0, x), which sets all negative values to zero. By setting all negative values to zero, the ReLU function creates multiple linear regions in the network, which allows the network to represent more complex functions.\nFor example, suppose you have a neural network with two layers, where the first layer has a linear activation function and the second layer has a ReLU activation function. The first layer can only perform a linear transformation on the input, while the second layer can perform a non-linear transformation. By having a non-linear function in the second layer, the network can learn more complex representations of the data.\nIn the case of your experiment, it's normal that the performance did not change much when you removed the ReLU function, because the dataset and the problem you were trying to solve might not be complex enough to require a ReLU function. In other words, a linear model might be sufficient for that problem, but for more complex problems, ReLU can be a critical component to achieve good performance.\nIt's also important to note that ReLU is not the only function to introduce non-linearity and other non-linear activation functions such as sigmoid and tanh could be used as well. The choice of activation function depends on the problem and dataset you are working with.",

    "answer": "ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance) is a statistical technique used to analyze the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and a categorical independent variable, while controlling for one or more continuous covariates. It extends the traditional ANOVA method by incorporating covariates into the analysis, enabling the assessment of the relationship between the main effects and the covariates. ANCOVA allows researchers to investigate how categorical variables impact continuous outcomes while accounting for the influence of covariates, providing a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between variables in statistical analysis.",

    "answer": "Currently, I have a Keras model that predicts accurately, but I found out that model.predict() only returns predictions for the values that are already known\n\nThat is incorrect. A predict statement doesn't just 'search and return' results from training data. That's not how machine learning works at all. The whole reason that you build models and have a train and test dataset is to ensure you have a model that is generalizable (i.e. can be used to make predictions on unseen data, assuming the observation is coming from the same underlying distribution that the model is trained on)\nIn your specific case, you are using a DateTime variable an independent, which means you should refrain from using variable such as year, which are non-recurring since you can use it to make predictions about the future (model learns patterns in 2019 but 2020 may be out of its vocabulary and thus years after that are not feasible to use for predictions.)\nInstead, you should engineer some features from your DateTime variable and use recurring variables which may show reveal some patterns in the dependent variable. These variables are like days of the week, months, seasons, hours of the day. Depending on what your dependent variable is, you can surely find some patterns in these.\nAll of this totally depends on what you are trying to model and what is the goal of the model.predict() w.r.t your problem statement.

I'll edit my post if I get a working solution.\nThe basic idea is to calculate all the derivatives of the function exp(-(x*x)) and use the coeficients to derive the integral form (by dividing those coeficients by one more than the exponent of x of the above function) to get the taylor series of the integral (I recommend you to use the unnormalized version described above to get the simple number coeficients, then adjust the result by multiplying by the proper constants)  you'll get a taylor series with good convergence, giving you precise values for full precision (The integral requires a lot of subdivision, and you cannot divide an unbounded interval into a finite number of intervals, all finite)\nI'll edit this question if I get on the code I wrote (so stay online, and dont' change the channel :) )",

    "question": "I am using Tensorflow to solve a regression problem with known dynamic components, that is, we are aware that the (singular) label at time t depends on some dynamic state of the environment, but this feature is unknown. The initial attempt to solve the problem via simple regression has, understandably, failed, confirming our assumption that there is some kind of dynamic influence by a feature we have no access to.\nHowever, the state of the environment at time t should be reflected somewhere in the features and labels (and in particular their interplay) known at times t0-n, where n > 0. Unfortunately, because of the nature of the problem, the output at time t heavily depends on the input at time t, about as much as it depends on the dynamic state of the environment. I am worried that this renders the approach I wanted to try ineffective - time series forecasting, in my understanding, would consider features from previous timesteps, but no inputs on the current timestep. Additionally, I know labels from previous timesteps, but not at the time at which I want to make my prediction.\nHere is a table to illustrate the problem:\n\n\n\n\nt\ninput\noutput\n\n\n\n\n0\nx(t=0)\ny(t=0)\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nt0-1\nx(t=t0-1)\ny(t=t0-1)\n\n\nt0\nx(t=t0)\ny(t=t0)=?\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I use all the information at my disposal to predict the value of y(t=t0), using x(t=t0) (where x is the array of input features) and a defined window of features and labels at previous timesteps?\nIs there an established method for solving a problem like this, either using a neural net or perhaps even a different model?\nDoes this problem require a combination of methods, and if so, which ones might be suitable for tackling it?\n\nThe final model is meant to be deployed and continue working for future time windows as well. We know the size of the relevant time window to be roughly 100 time steps into the past.",
    "answer": "The kind of problem I have described is, as I have since learned, linked to so-called exogenous variables. In my case, I require something called NNARX, which is similar to the ARMAX model at its core, but (as a neural net) can take non-linearity into account.\nThe general idea is to introduce an LSTM layer which acts as an Encoder for the historical input, which is then coupled to another input layer with the exogenous variables.

Your model may be too complex, or your data range may be so large that you run into floating point precision limits and the fitting algorithm can't detect any changes for parameter changes. The latter can often be avoided by normalizing your data (and model), or, for example, using log(-log) space instead of linear space.\nOr avoid leastsq altogether, and use a different minimization method (which will likely be much slower, but may produce overall better and more consistent results), such as the Nelder-Mead amoebe method.",

    "answer": "Yes, you can occasionally find other groups' pre-trained vectors for download, which may have better coverage of whatever problem domains they've been trained on: both more specialized words, and word-vectors matching the word sense in that domain. \nFor example, the GoogleNews word-vectors were trained on news articles circa 2012, so its vector for 'Java' may be dominated by stories of the Java island of Indosnesia as much as the programming language. And many other vector-sets are trained on Wikipedia text, which will be dominated by usages in that particular reference-style of writing. But there could be other sets that better emphasize the word-senses you need. \nHowever, the best approach is often to train your own word-vectors, from a training corpus that closely matches the topics/documents you are concerned about. Then, the word-vectors are well-tuned to your domain-of-concern. As long as you have \"enough\" varied examples of a word used in context, the resulting vector will likely be better than generic vectors from someone else's corpus. (\"Enough\" has no firm definition, but is usually at least 5, and ideally dozens to hundreds, of representative, diverse uses.)\nLet's consider your example goal – showing some similarity between the ideas of 'polymorphism' and 'input inheritance'. For that, you'd need a training corpus that discusses those concepts, ideally many times, from many authors, in many problem-contexts. (Textbooks, online articles, and Stack Overflow pages might be possible sources.) \nYou'd further need a tokenization strategy that manages to create a single word-token for the two-word concept 'input_inheritance' - which is a separate challenge, and might be tackled via (1) a hand-crafted glossary of multi-word-phrases that should be combined; (2) statistical analysis of word-pairs that seem to occur so often together, they should be combined; (3) more sophisticated grammar-aware phrase- and entity-detection preprocessing. \n(The multiword phrases in the GoogleNews set were created via a statistical algorithm which is also available in the gensim Python library as the Phrases class. But, the exact parameters Google used have not, as far as I know, been revealed.And, good results from this algorithm can require a lot of data and tuning, and still result in some combinations that a person would consider nonsense, and missing others that a person would consider natural.)",

    "question": "I have a dataset which I transformed to CSV as potential input for a keras auto encoder.\nThe loading of the CSV works flawless with pandas.read_csv() but the data types are not correct.\nThe csv solely contains two colums: label and features whereas the label column contains strings and the features column arrays with signed integers ([-1, 1]). So in general pretty simple structure.\nTo get two different dataframes for further processing I created them via:\nlabels = pd.DataFrame(columns=['label'], data=csv_data, dtype='U')\nand\nfeatures = pd.DataFrame(columns=['features'], data=csv_data)\nin both cases I got wrong datatypes as both are marked as object typed dataframes. What am I doing wrong?\nFor the features it is even harder because the parsing returns me a pandas.sequence that contains the array as string: ['[1, ..., 1]'].\nSo I tried a tedious workaround by parsing the string back to an numpy array via .to_numpy() a python cast for every element and than an np.assarray() - but the type of the dataframe is still incorrect. I think this could not be the general approach how to solve this task. As I am fairly new to pandas I checked some tutorials and the API but in most cases a cell in a dataframe rather contains a single value instead of a complete array. Maybe my overall design of the dataframe ist just not suitable for this task.\nAny help appreacheated!",

I'm trying to code a reasonably optimized solution so I don't have to let my PC sit for days.\nGoing through the C word2vec source code, I notice that there, each thread reads words from a file, and takes the time to look up the index of every word. At the end, it stores a \"sentence\" of word indexes.\nWouldn't it be logical to translate the whole corpus into one containing integer indexes of the appropriate words? That way, time isn't lost during training on hash-table lookups, while the translation process is a one-time expense.\nI understand that for extremely large corpuses, you are effectively doubling the amount it takes on disk, which you might want to avoid.\nHowever, if you do have the memory, wouldn't this offer a noticeable increase in efficiency? Or am I just overestimating the impact of a table lookup?",
    "answer": "Hashtable lookups can be very fast, and repeated lookups may not contribute much to the overall runtime.\nBut the only way to really know the potential speedup of your proposed optimization is to implement it, and profile it in comparison to the prior behavior. \nAlso, as you note, to be able to re-use a single-pass token-lookup, you'd need to store those results somewhere. Google's word2vec.c code, like many other implementations, seeks to work well with input corpuses that are far larger than addressable memory. Writing the interim tokenization to disk would require extra code complication, and extra working space on disk, compared to the baseline of repeated lookups.

    "answer": "**Step-by-Step Guide to Boosting Model Performance**\n\n**1. Data Preparation:**\n\n- Load the training dataset and preprocess it by handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.\n- Split the data into training and validation sets using cross-validation to prevent overfitting.\n\n**2. Base Learner Selection:**\n\n- Choose a weak base learner, such as a decision tree with a shallow depth or a logistic regression model.\n- Weak learners are simple models with high bias but low variance, which is ideal for boosting.\n\n**3. Iterative Training:**\n\n- Train the base learner on the training data.\n- Calculate the prediction errors (residuals) from the base learner's predictions.\n- Reweight the training instances based on the prediction errors. Instances with larger errors receive higher weights, forcing the subsequent learners to focus on these difficult examples.\n- Repeat steps a-c multiple times, adding new base learners to the ensemble.\n\n**4. Model Ensembling:**\n\n- Combine the predictions from the individual base learners using a weighted voting or averaging scheme.\n- The weights can be determined by the performance of each learner on the validation set.\n\n**5. Model Evaluation:**\n\n- Evaluate the performance of the boosted ensemble model on the validation set using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, AUC).\n- Make adjustments to the boosting parameters (e.g., number of iterations, learning rate) as needed to optimize performance.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n- Consider using different base learners for each iteration to introduce diversity into the ensemble.\n- Regularization techniques (e.g., early stopping, dropout) can be applied to prevent overfitting.\n- Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation is essential to find optimal boosting settings.\n- Ensemble methods like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting (GBDT), and XGBoost are popular boosting algorithms with proven effectiveness.",

They can be passed by\n  position or keyword.\nThe other two forms mimic the parameters from datetime.datetime.

I have changed the seeds, so that the code is reproducible, but it takes about 30 minutes for the reproducible error to occur.

Unfortunately the random state and dataset api pointer get reset when I do this. Is there any way to fully store the state of a network during runtime (including its random number generator state and the Dataset API pointer), so that when it is restored the same outputs get reproduced?",
    "answer": "From my personal experience I would approach it in the following ways.\n\nRunning the code with -i flag (python -i) which takes you to the interpreter with preserved state at the moment the script stops OR (even better) calling problematic parts of code from jupyter notebook which will also preserve the state after the exception is raised and you could investigate what the problem is more easily. If the problem is inside a function you could catch the exception and return all relevant objects. Or you could also put your functions inside the class to have a single object, instantiate and run it from jupyter and when the problem occurs you will have all variables inside that class object.\nAdding assert's statements for the shapes of your data and for the shapes of your model variables/placeholders. For example, if you have some preprocessing/augmentation add assert's before and after preprocessing/augmentation to be sure that the shapes are as expected.\nTaking a break. Sometimes you spend a lot of time and effort on something without success, but after having a rest you solve the problem immediately.\n\nGood luck!",

Balancing scalability with sustainability is an important consideration.\n- Data Privacy and Security: Scalable systems often involve distributed data storage and complex data processing. Safeguarding user data privacy and ensuring compliance with regulations are critical ethical responsibilities.\n- Algorithmic Bias: Scalable machine learning systems can perpetuate biases if not carefully designed and monitored. Addressing algorithmic fairness and mitigating potential discriminatory outcomes is an ongoing ethical debate.\n- Centralization Concerns: Highly scalable systems may lead to centralization of power and control over data. Striking a balance between scalability and decentralization to prevent monopolies and promote data sovereignty is essential.",

I am not sure considering computational time whether I need to use sparse csr_matrix or the raw data. Which version of the data runs faster with that classifier and can we generalize its answer to all sparse capable models?",
    "answer": "Depends on your data\nMemory consumption.\nIf your data is dense, a dense representation needs d*sizeof(double) bytes for your data (i.e. usually d * 8 bytes). A sparse representation usually needs sparsity*d*(sizeof(int)+sizeof(double)). Depending on your programming language and code quality, it can also be much more due to memory management overhead. A typical Java implementation adds 8 bytes of overhead, and will round to 8 bytes size; so sparse vectors may easily use 16 + sparsity * d * 24 bytes. then.\nIf your sparsity is 1, this means a sparse representation needs 50% more memory. I guess the memory tradeoff in practise will be somewhere around 50% sparsity; and if your implementation isn't carefull optimized, maybe even 30% - so 1 out of 3 values should be a zero.\nMemory consumption is usually a key problem. The more memory you use, the more pagefaults and cache misses your CPU will have, which can have a big impact on performance (which is why e.g. BLAS perform large matrix multiplications in block sizes optimized for your CPU caches).\nOptimizations and SIMD.\nDense vector code (e.g. BLAS) is usually much better optimized than sparse operations. In particular, SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) CPU instructions usually only work with dense data.\nRandom access.\nMany algorithms may need random access to vectors. If your data is represented as a double[] array, random access is O(1). If your data is a sparse vector, random access usually is O(sparsity*d), i.e. you will have to scan the vector to check if there is a value present. It may thus be beneficial to transpose the matrix for some operations, and work with sparse columns instead of sparse rows.\nOn the other hand, some algorithms may exactly benefit from this. But many implementations have such optimizations built in, and will take care of this automatically. Sometimes you also have different choices available. For example APRIORI works on rows, and thus will work well with row-sparse data. Eclat on the other hand is an algorithm to solve the same problem, but it first transforms all data into a row-sparse form, then even computes column differences to further optimize.\nCode complexity.\nCode to process sparse data usually is much more complex. In particular, it cannot make use of SSE and similar fast CPU instructions easily. It is one of the reasons why sparse matrix multiplications are much slower than dense operations - optimizing these operations without knowing certain characteristics of your data is surprisingly hard. :-(",

I know that LASSO is supposed to do feature selection and eliminate the unimportant ones (coefficient = 0), but in my analysis, it has selected all the features and did not eliminate any one of them. My questions are:\n\nIs this because I have too few features, or that the features are not correlated with each other(low co-linearity?)\nIs this a bad thing or a good thing for a classification model?\nsome coefficients of the features LASSO selected are less than 0.1, can I interpret them as non-important or not that important to the model?\n\np.s. I run the model using the sklearn package in python.\nThank you!",
    "answer": "Lasso did not fail to perform feature selection. It just determined that none of the 15 features were unimportant. For the one's where you get coefficients = 0.1 this just means that they are less important when compared to other more important features. So I would not be concerned!\nAlso 15 features is not a large amount of features for Lasso to determine the important one's. I mean it depends on the data so for some datasets, it can eliminate some features from a dataset of 10 features and sometimes it won't eliminate any from a dataset of 20.

Train it well and try using Image Augmentations to generate little more images because 32 images are less. In that case, you might end up in a pitfall of getting higher training accuracy but less test accuracy.

    "question": "I would like to see if someone can help me with a problem on optimising an emissions model, to essentially change the input conditions to match measured outputs.\nThe issue is the following. I have the following model data:\n\n\n\n\nTreatment group\n# of animals\nTreatment efficiency\nModel emissions\n\n\n\n\nControl\n110\n1\n110\n\n\nA\n88\n0.5\n44\n\n\nB\n22\n0.25\n5.5\n\n\n\n\nThe model predicts emissions from a barn with a set number of animals in it. In this case, there are 220 animals and the predicted TOTAL emissions are 159.5 units. Each animal emits 1 unit of emissions, unless the treatment applied reduces emissions by a set fraction, as indicated in the treatment efficiency for groups A and B.\nHowever, experimental measurements show TOTAL emissions to be 13.5 higher at 173.0\nFrom known information, we can confirm that the number of animals is definitely 220 and treatment efficiency is not in doubt. Therefore, the only variable that can explain this is that animals are not assigned to treatment groups as they are in the model. If more animals are part of the control group and less part of treatment groups A and B, then the emissions will go up and can approach the correct measured value.\nI am not very well versed in math, and too often I ran into things like this which ended up having more simple solutions. But my original model is in Excel and I don't think there is a way to do this with simple formulas. It feels like an optimisation problem to me. For example, if I add the 13.5 emissions to the control group, bringing total emissions to 123.5 for control and total emissions to the correct 173.0, then the number of animals in the control group has to become 123.5, to make sure emissions from the control group return to the max of 1 per animal. We can only get there by moving animals from groups A and B.\nI do this once under the constraint that animals have to be moved proportionally to treatment efficiency. This results in the following table after 1 iteration, moving 10.8 animal from group A and 2.7 (lets assume we can split up animals for the moment):\n\n\n\n\nTreatment group\n# of animals\nTreatment efficiency\nModel emissions\nEmission per animal\n\n\n\n\nControl\n123.5\n1\n123.5\n1\n\n\nA\n77.2\n0.5\n38.6\n0.56\n\n\nB\n19.3\n0.25\n3.825\n0.28\n\n\n\n\nNow, with the same number of animals, total emissions are 166.9. Closer to the observed value of 173.0. I can continue doing this and assume would approach to the right distribution of animals.\nNote that my real life problem is bigger than this, with up to 5 treatment groups and I have to repeat this for about 120 different setups of animals and treatment efficiencies. Hence I would like to automate this to find a way to optimise it towards the new correct distribution of animals. I think this can be done given we add the constraints:\n\nConstraint #1: Number of animals in treatment groups can only change proportionally.\n\nI assume without this constraint there is an infinite number of solutions.\n\nConstraint #2: If observed emissions are higher than modelled emissions, number of animals in the control group can't decrease.\n\nI think that is impossible for this to even happen with constraint #1 so this constraint may be superfluous, but in my real life problem this is the case so I added it anyway. There are no cases in my problem where observed emissions are lower than modelled emissions.\nI added R and python to this as those are the programming languages I know, though I haven't used it like this before for an optimisation problem so I would not really know where to start. Can anyone give any pointers?",

    "answer": "You've answered your own question pretty well. Most of the expensive computations should be within the OpenCV library, and thus independent of the language you use. \nIf you're really concerned about efficiency, you could profile your code and confirm that this is indeed the case. If need be, your custom processing functions, if any, could be coded in C/C++ and exposed in python through the method of your choice (eg: boost-python), to follow the same approach.\nBut in my experience, python works just fine as a \"composition\" tool for such a use.",

    "answer": "Evolution strategies are a form of optimization algorithm inspired by biological evolution. They are primarily distinguished by their approach to representing solutions, which is typically through a real-valued vector, and their use of a mutation operator to generate new solutions. There are several different approaches to using evolution strategies, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:\n\n**Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)**: CMA-ES is a popular evolution strategy that uses a covariance matrix to adapt the search distribution to the problem landscape. This allows CMA-ES to efficiently search complex and high-dimensional spaces. CMA-ES is particularly well-suited for problems where the fitness landscape is smooth and differentiable. \n\n**Cross-Entropy Method (CEM)**: CEM is an evolution strategy that uses a cross-entropy method to sample new solutions. CEM is less sensitive to the choice of mutation operator than other evolution strategies, making it a robust choice for a wide range of problems. However, CEM can be less efficient than CMA-ES on smooth fitness landscapes. \n\n**Natural Evolution Strategies (NES)**: NES is an evolution strategy that uses a natural gradient to update the mean and covariance of the search distribution. NES is similar to CMA-ES, but it uses a different approach to estimating the natural gradient. NES can be more efficient than CMA-ES on problems with non-smooth fitness landscapes. \n\n**Other evolution strategies**: In addition to CMA-ES, CEM, and NES, there are several other evolution strategies that can be used to solve optimization problems. These include the following:\n\n* **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: PSO is an evolution strategy that simulates the collective behavior of a swarm of particles in search for food. PSO is particularly well-suited for problems where the fitness landscape is dynamic or discontinuous.\n\n* **Differential Evolution**: Differential Evolution (DE) is an evolution strategy that uses a differential mutation operator to generate new solutions. DE is relatively simple to implement and can be efficient on a wide range of problems.\n\n* **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: GA is a form of evolutionary computation that uses a population-based approach to search for solutions. GAs are typically used to solve combinatorial optimization problems.\n\nThe choice of which evolution strategy to use depends on the specific problem being solved and the desired performance characteristics. For example, if the goal is to find the global optimum of a smooth fitness landscape, then CMA-ES may be a good choice. If the goal is to find a good solution quickly, then CEM may be a better choice. If the fitness landscape is non-smooth, then NES may be a better choice. Experimentation is often necessary to determine which evolution strategy is best suited for a particular problem.",

Using an adaptive stepsize is of particular importance when there is a large variation in the size of the derivative.",

    "question": "How does an actor-critic algorithm work? How would you use it to train agents for a decision-making task?",
    "answer": "**Overview of Actor-Critic Methods**\n\nActor-critic methods are a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that combines an actor network and a critic network to improve performance in decision-making tasks. Here's how they work:\n\n* **Actor Network:** The actor network is responsible for selecting actions based on the current state of the environment. It outputs a probability distribution over possible actions, and the action with the highest probability is chosen.\n* **Critic Network:** The critic network evaluates the value of the action taken by the actor network. It estimates the expected cumulative reward for the current state and action, providing feedback to the actor network.\n\n**Training Process:**\n\n1. Initialize the actor and critic networks with random weights.\n2. For each episode in the training process:\n    * Start in the initial state of the environment.\n    * The actor network selects an action based on the current state.\n    * The environment responds with a reward and a new state.\n    * The critic network evaluates the selected action.\n    * The actor and critic networks are updated using gradient descent to minimize the difference between the estimated value and the actual reward obtained. This process is repeated iteratively until the networks converge.\n\n**Use Case: Training Agents for Decision-Making Tasks**\n\nActor-critic methods can be applied to train agents for various decision-making tasks, such as playing games, controlling robotic systems, or optimizing investment strategies. Here's an example of how to use them in such a scenario:\n\n* Define the environment and reward function for the decision-making task.\n* Initialize the actor and critic networks.\n* Train the networks through repeated episodes of interaction with the environment.\n* As training progresses, the actor network will learn to select actions that maximize the expected cumulative reward, while the critic network will provide accurate value estimates.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* Actor-critic methods can be combined with other reinforcement learning techniques, such as Q-learning and policy gradients, to enhance performance.\n* They are particularly effective in continuous action spaces and complex decision-making tasks.\n* Proper hyperparameter tuning and architecture selection are crucial for maximizing the algorithm's effectiveness.",

    "question": "Yesterday I began to read about using bootstrapping to determine confidence intervals (CIs) in many situations. My current situation is that I am trying to estimate three parameters in a model via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This I have done, and now I need to define my CIs. This can obviously be done via profile likelihood, but bootstrapping will give a more broad CI interval as far as I can read. My problem is that I am unsure on how to actually perform bootstrapping ? I have written my own code for the parameter estimation, so no build-in MLE calculators.\nBasically the observed data I have is binary data, so 1 or 0. And it's from those data (put into a model with three parameters) that I have tried to estimate the parameter values.\nSo let's say my cohort is 500, is the idea then that I take a sample from my cohort, maybe 100, and then expand it to 500 again by just multiplying the sample 5 times, and run the simulation once again, which in turn should result in some new parameter estimates, and then just do this 1000-2000 times in order to get a series of parameter values, which can then be used to define the CI ?\nOr am I missing something here ?",
    "answer": "This question isn't related to Python. I think you need to read an intro to bootstrapping. \"An Introduciton to Statistical Learning\" provides a good one. The idea is not to sample 100 -- you must sample with replacement and taking the same sample size (500). Yes, then you reestimate your parameter many times. And then there's several ways of taking all of these estimates and turning them into a confidence interval. For example, you can use them to estimate the standard error (the standard deviation of the sampling distribution), and then use +/- 2*se.",

So it is correct to read it into pandas as an integer if you want to sum, average, or otherwise analyze that column. \nDates should be automatically parsed and, if they aren't, read_excel has a parse_dates parameter that allows you to do so.\nNow, depending on how you want to output the data after you've manipulated it in pandas, you could have a function that outputs a new dataframe that converts all values to string and applies formats to different columns.

    "question": "For an exploratory semester project, I am trying to predict the outcome value of a quality control measurement using various measurements made during production. For the project I was testing different algorithms (LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, ...). I generally get rather low r2-values (around 0.3), which is probably due to the scattering of the feature values and not my real problem here.\nInitially, I have around 100 features, which I am trying to reduce using RFE with LinearRegression() as estimator. Cross validation indicates, I should reduce my features to only 60 features. However, when I do so, for some models the R2-value increases. How is that possible? I was under the impression that adding variables to the model always increases R2 and thus reducing the number of variables should lead to lower R2 values.\nCan anyone comment on this or provide an explanation?\nThanks in advance.",
    "answer": "It depends on whether you are using the testing or training data to measure R2. This is a measure of how much of the variance of the data your model captures. So, if you increase the number of predictors then you are correct in that you do a better job predicting exactly where the training data lie and thus your R2 should increase (converse is true for decreasing the number of predictors).\nHowever, if you increase number of predictors too much you can overfit to the training data. This means the variance of the model is actually artificially high and thus your predictions on the test set will begin to suffer. Therefore, by reducing the number of predictors you actually might do a better job of predicting the test set data and thus your R2 should increase.",

As of right now, the model is a simple ConvLSTM model, which produces fairly good predictions. The problem is that I need to predict several minutes of voltage output on a millisecond timescale based on the initial 50 ms of ground truth voltage and the known current injections, so as I move forward in time, the model starts to rely on it's own predictions, therefore the prediction error compounds. I can measure the behavior of the system to obtain training datasets, but it's really slow, hence the need for a NN.\nIn my current mdoel I can only predict the next voltage value in time as the current input changes every millisecond, therefore long-term forecasting is not feasible. What I want to do is to build a model which takes 50 ms of ground truth training voltage, 60 ms of current input (starting at the same time as the voltage values, but exceeding it by 10 ms), and 10 milliseconds of voltage as a target. This would potentially help me to strenghten the first prediction (51st datapoint).\nUnfortunately no matter how long I searched, I haven't found an architecture which was capable of handling this kind of input.

While I don't think this has an effect, would the @ character be triggering this behavior?",
    "answer": "The dtype object comes from NumPy, it describes the type of element in a ndarray. Every element in an ndarray must have the same size in bytes. For int64 and float64, they are 8 bytes.

    "question": "I'm using a transfert-style based deep learning approach that use VGG (neural network). The latter works well with images of small size (512x512pixels), however it provides distorted results when input images are large (size > 1500px). The author of the approach suggested to divide the input large image to portions and perform style-transfert to portion1 and then to portion2 and finally concatenate the two portions to have a final large result image, because VGG was made for small images...  The problem with this approach is that the resulting image will have some inconsistent regions at the level of areas where the portions were \"glued\".\nHow can I correct these areas ?\nIs the an alternative approach to this dividing method ?",
    "answer": "Welcome to SO, jeanluc. Great first question.\nWhen you say VGG, I expect you're referring to VGG-16. This architecture uses fully connected layers in the end which means you can only use it with images of a certain size. I believe the ImageNet default is 224x224 pixels.\nIf you want to use VGG-16 without modifications, you MUST use images of this size. However, many people remove the fully connected layers in the end (especially in the context of style transfer) in order to feed in any size they want.\nAny size? Well, you probably want to make sure that the images are multiples of 32 because VGG-16 comes with 5 MaxPooling operations that half the dimensions every time.\nBut just because the network can now digest images of any size doesn't mean the predictions will be meaningful. VGG-16 learned what 1000 different objects look like on a scale of 224px. Using a 1500px of a cat might not activate the cat related neurons. Is that a problem?\nIt depends on your use case. I wouldn't trust VGG-16 to classify these high resolution images in the context of ImageNet but that is not what you're after. You want to use a pretrained VGG-16 because it should have learned some abilities that may come in handy in the context of style transfer. And this is usually true no matter the size of your input. It's almost always preferred to start out with a pretrained model in comparison to starting from scratch. You probably want to think about finetuning this model for your task because A) style transfer is quite different from classification and B) you're using a completely different scale of images.\nI've never found this recommended patch based approach to help because of precisely the same problems you're experiencing. While CNN learn to recognize local pattern in an images, they will also learn global distributions which is why this doesn't work nicely. You can always try to merge patches using interpolation techniques but personally I wouldn't waste time on that.\nInstead just feed in the full image like you mentioned which should work after you removed the fully connected layers. The scale will be off but there's little you can do if you really want high resolution inputs. Finetune VGG-16 so it can learn to adapt to your use case at hand.\nIn case you don't want to finetune, I don't think there's anything else you can do. Use the transformation/scale the network was trained on or accept less than optimal performance when you change the resolution.",

    "answer": "It seems that your data is categorical even though I do not exactly understand what you mean by player1 and player2. Do you have the names of the players or some skill set?\nNeural networks or any AI algorithm work with numbers. They do not know anything about the real world such as day name(Monday, Tuesday etc.) or Country names. What you have to do is you have to create a mapping between these real-world issues and numbers.\nThey are something categorical(it can not take a continuous value) you can map the days from 0 to N. For the countries you can do the same, every country can have a unique ID. You have to be careful tough if, during inference the model receives a day or country that was not extant in the training, it will be unknown to the model. So either adds all the countries that are relevant or if you can not know this in prior, you can add a label -1 for the case of unknown country and day.\nFor each feature, you will have a column and each row represents a match. In the column, you will have to correspondings IDs for that particular feature and match and you can pass this data to AI. By the way, it is okay that you use the same IDs/numbers for different features. (So you can you 1 for Tuesday and in the other Column 1 can be Switzerland)\nAnswers to your questions:\n\nYes, in theory, this can happen. If you have enough samples and a good model the model itself might learn it.\n\nIf you can do, you can input relative values to the model instead of absolute values. So for example, if you have some skill set attributes/scores with respect to players, instead of feeding both scores to the system, you can create your data based on the difference of these score. E.g shooting for player1 is 80 and for player2 78. You have a column for shooting and there you put the value 80-78, then the modal knows the player1 is better by 2 or if vice versa you could put -2 and thne th emodel knows the player2 is better by 2 in that category. Another approach would be to have each match 2 times in the training data. The second one with player orders reversed. The model might also learn this from the data.\n\nThat is easy to do, your model will output not players IDs or anything related to the player. Your problem is a binary classification problem. Your model should output in any case either 0 or 1. 0 meaning player1 wins, 1 meaning player2 wins and then you can convert this output to the players by yourself.",

More specifically, it tests whether non-linear combinations of the explanatory variables help to explain the response variable. The intuition behind the test is that if non-linear combinations of the explanatory variables have any power in explaining the response variable, the model is misspecified in the sense that the data generating process might be better approximated by a polynomial or another non-linear functional form.",

It was published by Kruskal's friend Martin Gardner and magician Karl Fulves in 1975.\n\nAdapted process: In the study of stochastic processes, a stochastic process is adapted (also referred to as a non-anticipating or non-anticipative process) if information about the value of the process at a given time is available at that same time. An informal interpretation is that X is adapted if and only if, for every realisation and every n, Xn is known at time n.\n\nBoth concepts have their own specific applications and characteristics in their respective domains.",

I could run multi-label classification and get the probability that each of the m is chosen and take the n most likely, but that ignores the correlation between items. I'm wondering if there is a modeling approach (ideally in Keras?) that considers the correlations.\nFor example, suppose a soccer team has 18 players and I'm trying to predict which 11 will start the next game. The 11 players who are individually most likely to start do not necessarily comprise the most likely group of 11 players to start. For instance, maybe the team has two goalkeepers, each of whom has a 50% chance of starting, but no configuration will start both of them.\nOne option is to predict the set of 11 directly, but that would be multiclass categorization problem with (18 choose 11) cases... Any thoughts on better routes?",
    "answer": "Seems kind of similar to a language model where you want to predict the most likely sentence. If you have the output probabilities for all words, you wouldn't just pick the n likeliest since the sentence would probably make no sense. Instead you condition it on the words you've already chosen.\nSo in your case, the input would include the already selected players. Each pass through the model you add the player with the highest output to the team. To increase the quality you may also want to use beam search, where you keep the best k teams each pass through.",

But in general, any distance function that fulfills d(a,a) = 0 (distance from a point to itself is zero), d(a,b) <= d(a,c) + d(c,b) (triangle inequality), and d(a,b) = d(b,a) (symmetry) can be used. It can even be a matrix where the entry M(i,j) gives the distance between items i and j, as long as the entries obey the rules above.",

    "answer": "Though I don't know the exact notations and equations, the answer has to do with the Big O Notation for the algorithms.\nBig O notation is a way of expressing the theoretical worse time for an algorithm to complete over extremely large data sets. For example, a simple loop that goes over every item in a one dimensional array of size n has a O(n) run time - which is to say that it will always run at the proportional time per size of the array no matter what.\nSay you have a 2 dimensional array of X,Y coords and you are going to loop across every potential combination of x/y locations, where x is size n and y is size m, your Big O would be O(mn)\nand so on. Big O is used to compare the relative speed of different algorithms in abstraction, so that you can try to determine which one is better to use.\nIf you grab O(n) over the different potential sizes of n, you end up with a straight 45 degree line on your graph.\nAs you get into more complex algorithms you can end up with O(n^2) or O(log n) or even more complex. -- generally though most algorithms fall into either O(n), O(n^(some exponent)), O(log n) or O(sqrt(n)) - there are obviously others but generally most fall into this with some form of co-efficient in front or after that modifies where they are on the graph. If you graph each one of those curves you'll see which ones are better for extremely large data sets very quickly\nIt would entirely depend on how well your algorithm is coded, but it might look something like this: (don't trust me on this math, i tried to start doing it and then just googled it.)\nFitting a decision tree of depth ‘m’:\n\nNaïve analysis: 2m-1 trees -> O(2m-1 n d log(n)).\neach object appearing only once at a given depth: O(m n d log n)\n\nand a Log n graph ... well pretty much doesn't change at all even with sufficiently large numbers of n, does it?\nso it doesn't matter how big your data set is, these algorithms are very efficient in what they do, but also do not scale because of the nature of a log curve on a graph (the worst increase in performance for +1 n is at the very beginning, then it levels off with only extremely minor increases to time with more and more n)",

    "question": "I have successfully used Q-learning to solve some classic reinforcement learning environments from OpenAI Gym (i.e. Taxi, CartPole). These environments allow for a single action to be taken at each time step. However I cannot find a way to solve problems where multiple actions are taken simultaneously at each time step. For example in the Roboschool Reacher environment, 2 torque values - one for each axis - must be specify at each time step. The problem is that the Q matrix is built from (state, action) pairs. However, if more than one action are taken simultaneously, it is not straightforward to build the Q matrix.\nThe book \"Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On\" by Maxim Lapan mentions this but does not give a clear answer, see quotation below.\n\nOf course, we're not limited to a single action to perform, and the environment could have multiple actions, such as pushing multiple buttons simultaneously or steering the wheel and pressing two pedals (brake and accelerator). To support such cases, Gym defines a special container class that allows the nesting of several action spaces into one unified action.\n\nDoes anybody know how to deal with multiple actions in Q learning?\nPS: I'm not talking about the issue \"continuous vs discrete action space\", which can be tackled with DDPG.",
    "answer": "You can take one of two approaches - depend on the problem:\n\nThink of the set of actions you need to pass to the environment as independent and make the network output actions values for each one (make softmax separately) - so if you need to pass two actions, the network will have two heads, one for each axis.\nThink of them as dependent and look on the Cartesian product of the sets of actions, and then make the network to output value for each product - so if you have two actions that you need to pass and 5 options for each, the size of output layer will be 2*5=10, and you just use softmax on that.",

For my problem, the image can be in a single category, multiple categories, or zero categories. Is it standard practice to set the zero category as all zeroes or should I add an additional null class neuron to the final layer?\nAs an example, let's say there are 5 categories (not including the null class). Currently, I'm representing that with [0,0,0,0,0]. The alternative is adding a null category, which would look like [0,0,0,0,0,1]. Won't there also be some additional unnecessary parameters in this second case or will this allow the model to perform better?\nI've looked on Stackoverflow for similar questions, but they pertain to Multiclass Classification, which uses the Categorical Crossentropy with softmax output instead of Binary Crossentropy with Sigmoid output, so the obvious choice there is to add the null class (or to do thresholding).",
    "answer": "The model outputs a probability to each class, and we assign the input to the class which has the highest probability during prediction. The last layer is normally a softmax layer for multiclass classification and sigmoid for binary classification. Both of them squash the input into a range of 0 to 1. We can interpret them as probabilities. So no you cannot have all zeros as a one class (Null), because their values will sum up to 1 (probability). You have to define a new class for Null.",

I can scroll through the 3d stack and find individual features that are common to the 2d image.

I would use as input arguments let's say 3 points (x1, y1, 0), (x2, y2, 0) and (x3, y3, 0) with some landmarks on the 2d image and then (x1', y1', z1'), (x2', y2', z2') and (x3', y3', z3') for the corresponding points into the 3d stack.

To warp a domain, however, you need to find another library or write TPS (thin plate spline) yourself; scipy doesn't do it. I recommend you check VTK, for example. You feed your landmark information of the reference image and the target image to a vtkThinPlateSplineTransform object.

Each row of my training set represents 1 hour blocks for each day of the year and has a little under 30,000 records going back 3.5 years. My features include parametric information such as date, station, day of week, start time as well as weather information. \nRecently I added 2 binary features which I expected would help the accuracy of the model but they don't. They are whether a station is running a contest at a given time (contests help to pull more audiences) and if the station is playing Christmas music or not (X-Mas music tends to also pull audiences). When I run a Pearson correlation of all my features vs. my dependent variable (amount of listening hours), these 2 features are in the top 4 of the most correlated features (0.16 for X-Mas music and 0.20 for contests) with the highest correlated feature sitting at 0.31. When there is a contest listening hours tend to double and when X_mas music is playing, hours tend to increase by about 50%. Interestingly, my predictions are also proportionately higher when these 2 features are True (1's).\nThe way I know that these features are not adding predictive value is that when I remove them from my dataset to train the model and make predictions, the model accuracy does not improve. I am measuring Mean Absolute Error, MSE and R2 to evaluate the model performance.\nAny ideas as to why important features to the dependant variable, not very correlated with other features, are not helping to reduce errors?\nI am running a RF with 100 trees. The issue is there if I only run a single tree as well.",
    "answer": "It could be that the other features that you are using as input are already enough to give accurate predictions. Thus including the two binary features does not improve the model accuracy. Id estimate variable importance to see how important the two binary features are relevant to overall predictions.",

    "question": "I want to use regex to match patterns in paragraphs like the following:\n\n©2016 Rina Foygel Barber and Emil Y. Sidky. Many optimization problems arising in high-dimensional statistics decompose naturally into a sum of several terms, where the individual terms are relatively simple but the composite objective function can only be optimized with iterative algorithms. In this paper, we are interested in optimization problems of the form F(Kx) + G(x), where K is a fixed linear transformation, while F and G are functions that may be nonconvex and/or nondifferentiable. In particular, if either of the terms are nonconvex, existing alternating minimization techniques may fail to converge; other types of existing approaches may instead be unable to handle nondifferentiability. We propose the mocca (mirrored convex/concave) algorithm, a primal/dual optimization approach that takes a local convex approximation to each term at every iteration. Inspired by optimization problems arising in computed tomography (CT) imaging, this algorithm can handle a range of nonconvex composite optimization problems, and offers theoretical guarantees for convergence when the overall problem is approximately convex (that is, any concavity in one term is balanced out by convexity in the other term). Empirical results show fast convergence for several structured signal recovery problems.\n\nSo that the first line with human names, year, and copyright (©2016 Rina Foygel Barber and Emil Y. Sidky.) can be removed.\nThe only I can come up now was to use ^© ?[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9].+\\.. However, this can hardly match things like the above paragraph due to the . in human names.

All of those files can be categorized in 6 different categories. All the examples that I have seen so far for buiding a CNN model are using either just one dataset in pandas or using several images of the same size. So the question would be, Can I use my data for creating a CNN model in this fashion?

    "answer": "It depends on the reason that the data are separated in different files in the first place and what you want to achieve.\nIf each file contains observations for a different entity AND you want to predict observations about EACH specific known entity, you can build a model for each entity. In this case, the entities with more training data will of course have better results.\nStill, if the difference between those entities can be described with numerical values, depending on the exact problem, you can also try adding those to the training data and then concatenating everything. In this case, the added features will make the final classification to better classify the observations of each different entity without building 100 models. Note however that this could work only if the \"qualities\" of the entities actually affect the observations in some degree, otherwise (if the observations are randomly distributed amongst the entities) the results will probably be worse.\nIf however the observations of different entities are needed to train a model that works for any entity (including unknown ones), the data can be concatenated to a single table (pandas DataFrames were mentioned in the question) and then train your model with this combined dataset.",

    "question": "Explain partial dependence plots as elaborately as possible.",
    "answer": "**Definition of Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs)**\n\nPartial dependence plots (PDPs) are graphical representations that show the relationship between a target variable and one or more predictor variables, while holding all other predictor variables constant. They are used to understand the marginal effect of each predictor variable on the target variable.\n\n**Historical Developments**\n\nPDPs were first introduced in the field of econometrics in the 1970s. They have since become widely used in machine learning and statistical modeling to gain insights into model predictions and variable importance.\n\n**Advanced Techniques and Strategies**\n\nThere are various advanced techniques and strategies used in PDPs:\n\n* **Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) Plots:** Similar to PDPs, ICE plots show the relationship between a predictor variable and the target variable, but they consider the individual predictions for each observation instead of the average.\n* **Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) Plots:** ALE plots display the cumulative effect of multiple predictor variables on the target variable, allowing for the analysis of interactions between variables.\n* **Partial Dependence Trees:** PDPs can be extended to decision tree models, where each node represents a split on a predictor variable and the plot shows the effect of the split on the target variable.\n\n**Common Misconceptions and Clarifications**\n\n* **Not capturing interactions:** PDPs only show the marginal effect of individual variables, so they may not fully capture complex interactions between predictor variables.\n* **Interpretation as regression coefficients:** PDPs are not regression coefficients and should not be interpreted as such. They represent the change in the target variable for a unit change in the predictor variable, holding all else constant.\n* **Smoothing techniques:** PDPs can be smoothed using techniques like kernel density estimation or loess to improve their interpretability.\n\n**Scenarios for PDPs**\n\nPDPs can be applied in various scenarios:\n\n* **Variable selection:** Identifying the most influential variables in a model.\n* **Model interpretation:** Understanding how model predictions are affected by different input variables.\n* **Sensitivity analysis:** Assessing the impact of changes in predictor variables on the target variable.\n* **Complex model visualization:** Simplifying the interpretation of complex models by focusing on individual variable effects.\n\nPDPs provide a powerful tool for understanding the relationships between variables and their impact on a target variable, making them an essential technique in data analysis and machine learning.",

    "question": "I am trying to replicate a neural network for depth estimation. The original authors have taken a pre-trained network and added between the fully connected layer and the convolutional layer a 'Superpixel Pooling Layer'. In this layer, the convolutional feature maps are upsampled and the features per superpixel are averaged. \nMy problem is that in order to successfully achieve this, I need to calculate the superpixels per image. How can I access the data being used by keras/tensorflow during batch processing to perform SLIC oversegmentation?\nI considered splitting the tasks and working by pieces i.e. feed the images into the convolutional network. Process the outputs separately and then feed them into a fully connected layer. However, this makes further training of the network impossible.",
    "answer": "At the time it seems to be impossible to actually access the data within the symbolic tensor. It also seems unlikely that such functionality will be added in the future since in the Tensorflow page it says:\n\nA Tensor object is a symbolic handle to the result of an operation, but \n  does not actually hold the values of the operation's output. \n\nKeras allows for the creation of personalized layers.

    "answer": "I don't think svm will work well here. It is binary classifier by native. It will try to compute the border between two 128D points sets (known and unknown classes), but these classes are not internally connected with any relations. Known may be similar to unknown more than to another known in embedding space. That will be a problem for generalization for SVM. SVM may be used on closed sets, but you have open set for unknown faces.\nIt is more practical to use non-parametric methods, and use Bayesian approach, computing likelihoods as function of distance for known data in embedding space.

We have a specific need for being able to split paragraphs into sentences while expecting the worst case that paragraph inputted are improper.\nExample:\nthis is a sentence this is a sentence this is a sentence this is a sentence this is a sentence\ninto\n[\"this is a sentence\", \"this is a sentence\", \"this is a sentence\", \"this is a sentence\", \"this is a sentence\"]\nThe sentence tokenizer that we have tried so far seems to rely on punctuations and true casing:\nUsing nltk.sent_tokenize\n\"This is a sentence.

    "answer": "This is a hard problem, and you are likely better off trying to figure out how to deal with imperfect sentence segmentation. That said there are some ways you can deal with this.\nYou can try to train a sentence segmenter from scratch using a sequence labeller. The sentencizer in spaCy is one such model. This should be pretty easy to configure, but without punctuation or case I'm not sure how well it'd work.\nThe other thing you can do is use a parser that segments text into sentences. The spaCy parser does this, but its training data is properly cased and punctuated, so you'd need to train your own model to do this. You could use the output of the parser on normal sentences, with everything lower cased and punctuation removed, as training data. Normally this kind of training data is inferior to the original, but given your specific needs it should be easy to get at least.\nOther possibilities involve using models to add punctuation and casing back, but in that case you run into issues that errors in the models will compound, so it's probably harder than predicting sentence boundaries directly.",

I've imported the node/edge data from OSMnx and am trying to solve the model with Gurobi Optimizer in Python.\nTo be able to use the OSMnx data with Gurobi, I created a matrix = len(nodes) x len(nodes) matrix and therein printed the length of the edge if two nodes were connected, and a large number otherwise. In the optimization, a x[i,j] = len(nodes) x len(nodes) binary decision variable is used to decide if an edge is traversed or not.\nThe problem I am encountering is a large computing time for just one request (+1 hour). I think this is because the model also has to consider all the other indices from this large matrix, even though they can be ignored completely since they represent that two nodes are unconnected.\nMy question therefore is if someone can help me find some preprocessing techniques or something else that might reduce my computational time. For example, tell the model that it can ignore indices from this matrix if the value is too high or maybe a more efficient node/edge storage file that Gurobi can use more efficiently.\nThanks in advance.",
    "answer": "If your graph is sparse, the optimization model should be sparse, too. Specifically, you should only create a variable x[i,j] if the edge (i,j) exists in the graph. For an example of how to do this, see the netflow.py sample in the examples/python subdirectory of Gurobi.",

(even if 100k labeled images would result in better performance)\nmultilabel image classification model will get affected by 0 labeled attributes as well. if only 20k out of 100k palm images will be labeled, the model gets confused, because 80k images have a palm on it, but arent labeled as palm. result would be weak performance regarding this label. if thats the case, all 100k images have to be labeled for strong performance.\n\nAm I right with one of the two suggestions or does multilabel image classification work different?\nI have a very big dataset and I have to label all my images by hand, which takes a lot of time. If my first suggestion works, I could save myself weeks of work.\nI would appreciate a lot, if you share your expertise, experiences and whys!",
    "answer": "The training process uses the negative cases just as much as the positive cases to learn what a palm is. So if some of the supplied negative cases actually contain a palm tree, your model will have a much harder time learning.

    "answer": "Grid search is known to be worse than random search for optimizing hyperparameters [1], both in theory and in practice. Never use grid search unless you are optimizing one parameter only.\nOn the other hand, Bayesian optimization is stated to outperform random search on various problems, also for optimizing hyperparameters [2]. However, this does not take into account several things: the generalization capabilities of models that use those hyperparameters, the effort to use Bayesian optimization compared to the much simpler random search, and the possibility to use random search in parallel.\nSo in conclusion, my recommendation is: never use grid search, use random search if you just want to try a few hyperparameters and can try them in parallel (or if you want the hyperparameters to generalize to different problems), and use Bayesian optimization if you want the best results and are willing to use a more advanced method.\n[1] Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization, Bergstra & Bengio 2012.\n[2] Bayesian Optimization is Superior to Random Search for Machine Learning Hyperparameter Tuning: Analysis of the Black-Box Optimization Challenge 2020, Turner et al. 2021.",

The data inside of these images is a smaller image that’s usually around 25x25 pixels somewhere inside of the 512x512 region , though the actual size of the smaller image is not consitant and changes for each image. I want to get the sparse information from this format and turn it into a numpy array with only the data in the smaller image; so if I have an image that’s 512x512 but there’s a circle in a 20x20 area in the center I want to just get the 20x20 area with the circle and not get the rest of the 512x512 image. I know that I can use .A to turn the image into a non-sparse format and get a 512x512 numpy array, but this option isn’t ideal for my RAM.\nIs there a way to extract the smaller images stored in a sparse format without turning the sparse data into dense data?\nI tried to turn the sparse data into dense data, reshape it into a 512x512 image, and then I wrote a program to find the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the image by checking for the first occurrence of data from the top, bottom, left, and right but this whole processes seemed horribly inefficient.",
    "answer": "Sorry about the little amount of information I provided; I ended up figuring it out.Scipy's loadmat function when used to extract sparse data from a mat file returns a csc_matrix, which I then converted to numpy's compressed sparse column format.

I then reshaped the numpy csc matrix into 512x512, and then used .nonzero() to get the non-zero elements in 2D, then used used those indexes to figure out the max height and width of my image I was interested in. Then I created a numpy matrix of zeros the size of the image I wanted, and set the elements in that numpy matrix to the elements to the pixels I wanted by indexing into my numpy csc matrix (after I called .tocsr() on it)",

I can build the network, but have to use system RAM since the model is too large to fit in my GPU, which has meant it's taken days to run the model on my machine. The input is currently 500,20000,1 to an output of 500,1,1\n-I'm using 5,000 nodes in the first fully connected (Dense) layer. Is this sufficient for the number of features?\n-Is there a way of reducing the dimensionality so as to run it on my GPU?",
    "answer": "I suppose each input entry has size (20000, 1) and you have 500 entries which make up your database?\nIn that case you can start by reducing the batch_size, but I also suppose that you mean that even the network weights don't fit in you GPU memory. In that case the only thing (that I know of) that you can do is dimensionality reduction.\nYou have 20000 features, but it is highly unlikely that all of them are important for the output value. With PCA (Principal Component Analysis) you can check the importance of all you parameters and you will probably see that only a few of them combined will be 90% or more important for the end result. In this case you can disregard the unimportant features and create a network that predicts the output based on let's say only 1000 (or even less) features.\nAn important note: The only reason I can think of where you would need that many features, is if you are dealing with an image, a spectrum (you can see a spectrum as a 1D image), ... In this case I recommend looking into convolutional neural networks. They are not fully-connected, which removes a lot of trainable parameters while probably performing even better.",

The value itself of the time step corresponds to a categorical position on the body (ranging from 1-20) where the muscle activiation occured.\nSo the data resembles, (time, position):\n(0.1, 16)\n(0.16, 1)\n(0.25, 13)\n(0.26, 12)\n(0.27, 1)\n(0.4, 4)\nIs there a clustering algorithm which will be able to work for this type of data.

Dynamic time warping is not suitable for unevenly spaced time series data and I am not sure how it would handle the sparse categorical data I have, e.g. a given position will only appear once per sample.\nAny suggestions or help is appreciated.\nI have looked through lots of different models, but none so far work with their given assumptions.

    "answer": "One method you can use for clustering this type of time-dependent data is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). HMMs can model the dependencies between the positions and the time steps, allowing for the clustering of similar patterns in the data. Another alternative is a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), where you can model the position and time values as multivariate Gaussian distributions, and use Expectation-Maximization (EM) to estimate the parameters of the distributions. Both HMMs and GMMs have been used in various time-series analysis and clustering tasks, and both have Python implementations available through popular libraries such as scikit-learn and hmmlearn.\nIt is recommended to try out both algorithms and compare the results to see which one performs better for your specific dataset.

Most rows have about 10-20 features.\nI used KMeans to cluster the data, always resulting in a cluster with a large number of members. Upon analysis, I noticed that rows with fewer than 4 features tends to get clustered together, which is not what I want.\nIs there anyway balance out the clusters?",

Encoded categoricial variables, binary variables, and sparse data just are not well suited for k-means use of means. Furthermore, you'd probably need to carefully weight variables, too.\nNow a hotfix that will likely improve your results (at least the perceived quality, because I do not think it makes them statistically any better) is to normalize each vector to unit length (Euclidean norm 1).

Your best bet is to write a (fast, possibly recursive) loop for the inner points, and then loop over the boundary points separately, imposing the desired boundary conditions there. Obviously, the other way around also works: start by assigning boundary points, then loop over inner points.\nThat said, if you are having issues with speed (probably because your grid is gigantic), you may want to do a few optimizations, as 2d arrays in python are S L O W:\n\ntry reversing the order of looping: in python (NumPy, in case you are using that), 2d arrays are traversed by rows first. You may want to experiment with that at least.\n\ntry allocating your 2d thing as a big 1d chunk where its unique index is n = i + nx * j, with i,j your original 2d indices.

During this preprocessing step, I want to treat continuous and categorical data differently.

What is a good heuristic to use to determine whether a column in the pandas.DataFrame is categorical?\nMy initial thoughts are:\n1) If there are strings in the column (e.g., the column data type is object), then the column very likely contains categorical data\n2) If some percentage of the values in the column is unique (e.g., >=20%), then the column very likely contains continuous data\nI've found 1) to work fine, but 2) hasn't panned out very well. I need better heuristics. How would you solve this problem?\nEdit: Someone requested that I explain why 2) didn't work well. There were some tests cases where we still had continuous values in a column but there weren't many unique values in the column. The heuristic in 2) obviously failed in that case. There were also issues where we had a categorical column that had many, many unique values, e.g., passenger names in the Titanic data set. Same column type misclassification problem there.",

Now a new type of cars come to the market which is eV (for electric vehicle). I want to know if there is a way to accommodate EVs without retraining a model. \nIn my case, the categorical variable has roughly 50 different levels and new levels may be added as time goes on or old ones may be deleted. How do I go about modeling the data without retraining the entire model each time it happens, if it is at all possible?\nYour suggestions will be greatly appreciated.\nThank you.",
    "answer": "The best way is to just retrain your model. \nThinking about how a categorical variable affects your model might be helpful. Categorical variables are generally treated a binary variables where each category is its own column, the row in that column is a 1 if that category is present and a 0 otherwise. Now imagine adding an additional column to your data for which your model has not been trained, as would be the case with a new category... this will result in sub-optimal performance. Most likely, this new column will have no affect on the model prediction. \nThere are examples of what you are suggesting, but they require a secondary model be fed into a primary model. We see this often in Natural Language Processing, where there is a model for how texts are similar (a word vector) and this model is then fed into another model that predicts things like text category and sentiment. \nSo basically, if you can model the similarities of your categorical variables (this is your secondary model), and feed that model into primary model, then you would only need update your secondary model when you get new data.

But to do so, I'd have to pass a lot of new input-parameters to the ANN: x,y coordinates of the agent and x,y coordinates of the last visited platform.\nFurthermore, the ANN then would also have to learn that a platform is 4 blocks thick, and so on. \nTherefore, I'm sure that this idea I just mentioned wouldn't solve the problem, contrarily I believe that the ANN would in general simply not learn well anymore, because there are too many unuseful and complex-to-understand inputs.",

    "question": "I am working with satellite images with different spatial resolutions, understood as pixel/meter. For experiments I want to artificially down-sample these images, keeping the image size constant. For example I have a 512x512 image with spatial resolution 0.3m/pixel. I want to downsample it to 0.5m/pixel 512x512. I got advised to apply a Gaussian kernel to blur the image. But how do I calculate the standard deviation and kernel size of a Gaussian kernel to approximate the desired lower resolution? I can't find a rigorous method to do that calculation. Any help really much appreciated!\nChatGTP says that the formula is:\nsigma = (desired_resolution / current_resolution) / (2 * sqrt(2 * log(2)))\nand kernel_size = 2 * ceil(2 * sigma) + 1\nBut can't explain why. Can someone explain how standard deviation (sigma) and desired output resolution are connected? And how do I know which sigma to use? Oftentimes these existing resizing functions ask for a sigma, but in their documentation don't explain how to derive it.",
    "answer": "I wonder where that equation for the sigma comes from, I have never seen it. It is hard to define a cutoff frequency for the Gaussian.\nThe Gaussian filter is quite compact in both the spatial domain and the frequency domain, and therefore is an extremely good low-pass filter. But it has no clear point at which it attenuates all higher frequencies sufficiently to no longer produce visible aliasing artifacts, without also attenuating lower frequencies so much that the downsampled image looks blurry.\nOf course we can follow the tradition from the field of electronics, and define the cutoff frequency as the frequency above which the signal gets attenuated with at least 3dB. I think this definition might have lead to the equation in the OP, though I don’t feel like attempting to replicate that computation.\nFrom personal experience, I find 0.5 times the subsampling factor to be a good compromise for regular images. For example, to downsample by a factor of 2, I’d apply a Gaussian filter with sigma 1.0 first. For OP’s example of going from 0.3 to 0.5 m per pixel, the downsampling factor is 0.5/0.3 = 1.667, half that is 0.833.\nNote that a Gaussian kernel with a sigma below 0.8 cannot be sampled properly without excessive aliasing, applying a Gaussian filter with a smaller sigma should be done through multiplication in the frequency domain.\nFinally, the kernel size. The Gaussian is infinite in size, but it becomes nearly zero very quickly, and we can truncate it without too much loss. The calculation 2 * ceil(2 * sigma) + 1 takes the central portion of the Gaussian of at least four sigma, two sigma to either side. The ceiling operation is the “at least”, it needs to be an integer size of course. The +1 accounts for the central pixel. This equation always produces an odd size kernel, so it can be symmetric around the origin.\nHowever, two sigma is quite small for a Gaussian filter, it cuts off too much of the bell shape, affecting some of the good qualities of the filter. I always recommend using three sigma to either side: 2 * ceil(3 * sigma) + 1. For some applications the difference might not matter, but if your goal is to quantify, I would certainly try to avoid any sources of error.",

    "answer": "**Copyright and Intellectual Property:**\n\nIn online learning, copyright and intellectual property (IP) rights are crucial to protect the original works of creators and educators. However, the complexities arise when: \n\n* **Fair Use:** The doctrine of fair use allows limited use of copyrighted material for educational purposes without permission. However, the interpretation and boundaries of fair use vary across jurisdictions. \n\n* **Open Educational Resources (OERs):** OERs are freely available educational materials that can be reused, revised, and shared. Understanding licensing terms and copyright restrictions is essential for educators to avoid IP infringement. \n\n**Privacy Regulations:**\n\nPrivacy concerns are paramount in online learning, given the collection and processing of student data. Educators and platforms must comply with regulations such as:\n\n* **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU:** GDPR mandates strict measures for data protection, including consent, data subject rights, and breach notifications. \n\n* **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) in the US:** FERPA protects the privacy of student educational records, including online activities. \n\n**Jurisdictional Differences:**\n\nRegulations vary significantly across jurisdictions, making it challenging for educators to navigate compliance. For instance:\n\n* The European Union has a comprehensive framework for copyright and privacy, with strict enforcement measures. \n\n* The United States has a more case-by-case approach to fair use and privacy, relying on court interpretations. \n\n**Risks for Educators and Learners:**\n\n* **Copyright Infringement:** Using copyrighted materials without permission can lead to legal consequences, including fines or imprisonment. \n\n* **Privacy Breaches:** Failure to comply with privacy regulations can result in data breaches, reputational damage, and legal penalties. \n\n**To mitigate these risks:**\n\n* Educators should seek guidance from legal experts and institutional policies on copyright and privacy compliance. \n\n* Learners should be educated about responsible use of online resources and their privacy rights.",

    "question": "So my understanding is that you perform one hot encoding to convert categorical features as integers to fit them to scikit learn machine learning classifier.\nSo let's say we have two choices\na. Splitting all the features into one hot encoded features (if A is say a categorical features that takes values 'a', 'b' and 'c', then it becomes A_a, A_b and A_c with binary values in each of its rows with binary value '1' meaning that the observation has the feature and binary value '0' meaning it does not possess the feature!). I would then fit a DecisionTreeClassifier on this.\nb. Not splitting all the features, but converting each category into an integer value WITHOUT performing one hot encoding (if A is say a categorical features that takes values 'a', 'b' and 'c', then 'a', 'b' and 'c' are renamed as 1, 2, 3 and no new columns are created, 'A' remains a single column with integer values 1, 2, 3 by using pandas.factorize or something which you an then fit a DecisionTreeClassifier.\nMy question is, when you fit DecisionTreeClassifier on the one hot encoded dataset, with multiple columns, will each of the new columns be treated as a separate feature?\nAlso, if you fit the DecisionTreeClassifier on the dataset where the categorical features are simply converted to an integer and kept in a single column; will it produce the same node splits, as the one where the DecisionTreeClassifier was fit on the dataset with the one-hot encoded features?\nLike, when you visualize the tree in both cases, \nis the interpretation given below the right way to look at it?\nfor DecisionTreeClassifier with one-hot-encoding\nif attribute == A_a, then yes\nif attribute == A_b, then no\nfor DecisionTreeClassifier without one-hot-encoding ('a' represented by integer value 1 and 'b' by value 2)\nif attribute == 1 then yes\nif attribute == 2, then no",
    "answer": "The two options you are describing do two very different things. \nIf you choose to binarize (one-hot encode) the values of the variable, there is no order to them. The decision tree at each split, considers a binary split on each of the new binary variables and chooses the most informative one. So yes, each binary feature is now treated as an independent feature.\nThe second choice puts the values in an order. Implicitly you are saying that a < b < c if transforming a=1, b=2, c=3. If you use this variable in a decision tree, the algorithm considers the splits 1 vs 2,3 and 1,2 vs 3 (but not 3 vs 1,2). \nSo the meaning of the variables is very different and I don't think you can expect equivalent results.",

I'm currently translating Matlab code to Python code and I often need to compare outputs of functions. In PyCharm's debugger, I can right click on a variable in the variable space and then press « View as array ». This gives me a nice grid view of my array (Excel kind of grid) and I can easily compare with my array in Matlab, which can also be displayed in a grid. However, sometimes, this option won't work in PyCharm and I don't know why! For example, I have a variable of type numpy.ndarray containing 137 by 60 floats and when I press « view as array », it displays the window, but instead of showing the grid, it shows « Nothing to show ». Curiously, I tried to copy the first 30 lines in another variable and this time PyCharm was able to show me the grid associated with this new variable. Usually, the number doesn't seem to be a problem. I tried to display a 500 by 500 array containing floats and it did just fine.\nIf someone could tell me why this happens and how I can overcome this problem, I'd be very glad. Also, if anyone has another way to display a matrix in Python in an elegant way, I'd take it too since it could also help me in my task! \nThanks!",

    "answer": "Certainly! Grid search is widely used in machine learning to find the best hyperparameters for a given model. Here's a detailed example of how it can be implemented:\n\nLet's say you are working on a machine learning problem involving image classification. You have chosen to use a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for this task.\n\nSVM has several hyperparameters that can impact its performance, such as the kernel type, the regularization parameter, and the gamma parameter. To find the optimal combination of these hyperparameters, you can use grid search in the following steps:\n\n1. Define a grid of hyperparameter values. For example, you could define a grid of kernel types (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF), regularization parameters (e.g., 0.1, 0.01, 0.001), and gamma parameters (e.g., 0.1, 1, 10).\n\n2. Train the SVM classifier for each combination of hyperparameter values. Evaluate the performance of each trained model on a validation set. A common performance metric for classification tasks is accuracy, which measures the proportion of correctly classified instances.\n\n3. Choose the combination of hyperparameters that results in the highest performance on the validation set. This combination of hyperparameters is considered the optimal set found through grid search.\n\nUsing grid search, you can systematically explore different combinations of hyperparameter values and identify the set that leads to the best model performance for your specific machine learning problem.",

How can I fix it?\n(Numpy's random choice method requires probabilities to sum up to 1)",
    "answer": "Due to floating point arithmetic errors, you can get tiny errors in what seem like ordinary calculations. However, in order to use the choice function, the probabilities don't need to be perfect.\nOn reviewing the code in the current version of Numpy as obtained from Github, I see that the tolerance for the sum of probabilities is that sum(p) is within sqrt(eps) of 1, where eps is the double precision floating point epsilon, which is approximately 1e-16. So the tolerance is about 1e-8. (See lines 955 and 973 in numpy/random/mtrand.pyx.)\nFarther down in mtrand.pyx, choice normalizes the probabilities (which are already almost normalized) to sum to 1; see line 1017.\nMy advice is to ensure that all 16 digits are stored in the csv, then when you read them back, the error in the sum will be much smaller than 1e-8 and choice will be happy.

Moreover, the verbose output of the .fit() method shows the steps of a single optimization, and this makes me even more doubtful.\nIf it is not using EM, what is it doing? maybe I am missing something here, but I thought that for models with hidden variables (like state space models) you cannot directly minimize the likelihood (since you don't know and don't observe the hidden states).\nthanks for any suggestion",
    "answer": "In general, fit() is a method of the model class. Depending on the class object the method fit() from that class will be called. In general, fit() estimates parameters via maximum likelihood and return a results object.\nThe expectation maximization (EM) algorithm requires and uses the Kalman smoother for models with hidden variables if I'm not mistaken.\nEDIT: fit() will cal the fit() of its parent class which in this case is tsbase.TimeSeriesModel as seen in class MLEModel(tsbase.TimeSeriesModel). In turn, class TimeSeriesModel(base.LikelihoodModel) will call its parent class which is base.LikelihoodModel. class LikelihoodModel(Model)'s fit() function default method argument is 'newton'. Thus, Maximum likelihood (ML) estimation will be estimated using Newton's method in this custom state space model.",

The data looks something like this (15 participants with almost equal number of rows each and 15 features) -\n\n\n\n\nParticipant\ntime\nfeature 1\nfeature 2...\n\n\n\n\n1\n0.05\nval\nval\n\n\n1\n0.10\nval\nval\n\n\n2\n0.05\nval\nval\n\n\n2\n0.10\nval\nval\n\n\n2\n0.15\nval\nval\n\n\n\n\nThe data consists of many participants, each participant has multiple rows of data and they are time stamped with their features. My goal is to cluster this data according to participants and make inferences based on these clusters. The problem here is that there are many rows for each participant and I cannot represent each participant with a single point so clustering them seems like a difficult task.\nI would like help with:\n\nWhat would be the best way to cluster this data so that I can make inferences according to the participant ?\n\nWhich clustering technique should I use? I have tried sklearn's Kmeans, meanshift and other libraries but they take too long and crash my system.\n\n\nSorry If it's a bit difficult to understand I will try my best to answer your questions. Thank you in advance for the help. If this question is very similar to some other question please let me know (I was not able to find it).\nThank you :)",
    "answer": "Since you have trouble with the necessary amount of compute you have to make some sort of compromise here. Here's a few suggestions that will likely fix your problem, but they all come at a cost.\n\nDimension reduction i.e. PCA to reduce your number of columns to ~2 or so. You will lose some information, but you will be able to plot it and do inference via K-means.\n\nAverage the patients data. Not sure if this will be enough, this depends on you data. This will lose the over-time observation of your patients but likely drastically reduce your number of rows.\n\n\nMy suggestion is to do dimension reduction since losing the over time data on your patients might render your data useless. There is also other stuff beside PCA, for example auto encoders. For clustering the way your descibe I'd recommend you stick to K-means or soft K-means.",

    "answer": "**Definition:**\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model specifically designed to process data that has a grid-like structure, such as images. CNNs are able to learn the important features in data, making them well-suited for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.\n\n**Methods that have contributed to Modern CNNs:**\n\n- **Convolution:** This operation involves sliding a filter over the input data to extract features. The filter is typically a small matrix, and the output of the convolution is a feature map that shows how the filter responds to different parts of the input.\n\n- **Pooling:** Pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps by combining neighboring values. This helps to make the network more robust to noise and variations in the input data.\n\n- **Activation Functions:** Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network. This allows the network to learn more complex relationships in the data.\n\n- **Fully Connected Layers:** Fully connected layers are used at the end of the CNN to classify the input data.These methods have enabled CNNs to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of computer vision tasks.",

    "question": "Provide me with information about the exponential decay learning rate schedule.",
    "answer": "**Exponential Decay Learning Rate Schedule**\n\nThe exponential decay learning rate schedule is a technique used in machine learning to gradually reduce the learning rate as training progresses. This helps to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\nThe learning rate is updated at each iteration of the training process using the following formula:\n\n```\nnew_learning_rate = initial_learning_rate * decay_rate ^ (current_iteration / decay_steps)\n```\n\nwhere:\n\n- initial_learning_rate: The initial learning rate at the beginning of training.\n\n- decay_rate: A factor between 0 and 1 that controls the rate of decay.\n\n- current_iteration: The current iteration of the training process.\n\n- decay_steps: The number of iterations over which the learning rate will be decayed.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose we have an initial learning rate of 0.1, a decay rate of 0.9, and we want to decay the learning rate over 1000 iterations. The new learning rate after 10 iterations would be:\n\n```\nnew_learning_rate = 0.1 * 0.9 ^ (10 / 1000) = 0.099\n```\n\n**Benefits of Exponential Decay Learning Rate Schedule:**\n\n- Prevents overfitting: By reducing the learning rate over time, the model is less likely to memorize the training data and more likely to generalize well to new data.\n\n- Improves convergence: The exponential decay schedule helps to ensure that the model converges smoothly and efficiently to the optimal solution.\n\n- **Additional Considerations:**\n\n- **Choosing the Decay Rate:** The optimal decay rate depends on the specific problem and dataset being used. It is recommended to experiment with different values to find the best setting.\n\n- **Cross-disciplinary Applications:** The exponential decay learning rate schedule is used in various disciplines beyond machine learning, including signal processing and optimization.",

    "question": "I`m trying to make a research in which the observations of my dataset are represented by matrices (arrays composed of numbers, similar to how images for deep learning are represented, but mine are not images) of different shapes.\nWhat I`ve already tried is to write those arrays as lists in one column of a pandas dataframe and then save this as a csv\\excel. After that I planned just to load such a file and convert those lists to arrays of appropriate shapes and then to convert a set of such arrays to a tensor which I finally will use for training the deep model in keras.\nBut it seems like this method is extremely inefficient, cause only 1/6 of my dataset has already occupied about 6 Gb of memory (pandas saved as csv) which is huge and I won't be able to load it in RAM (I'm using google colab to run my experiments).\nSo my question is: is there any other way of storing a set of arrays of different shapes, which won`t occupy so much memory? Maybe I can store tensors directly somehow? Or maybe there are some ways to store pandas in some compressed types of files which are not so heavy?",
    "answer": "Are you storing purely (or mostly) continuous variables? If so, maybe you could reduce the accuracy (i.e., from float64 to float32) these variables if you don't need need such an accurate value per datapoint.\nThere's a bunch of ways in reducing the size of your data that's being stored in your memory, and the what's written is one of the many ways to do so. Maybe you could break the process that you've mentioned into smaller chunks (i.e., storage of data, extraction of data), and work on each chunk/stage individually, which hopefully will reduce the overall size of your data!\nOtherwise, you could perhaps take advantage of database management systems (SQL or NoSQL depending on which fits best) which might be better, though querying that amount of data might constitute yet another issue.\nI'm by no means an expert in this but I'm just explaining more of how I've dealt with excessively large datasets (similar to what you're currently experiencing) in the past, and I'm pretty sure someone here will probably give you a more definitive answer as compared to my 'a little of everything' answer.

    "answer": "You can add a delay to the right or left track, to account for the arrival time at the two ears. If I recall correctly, it amounts to up to about 25 or 30 milliseconds, depending on the angle. The travel distance disparity from source to the two ears can be calculated with basic trigonometry, and then multiplied by speed of sound in air to get the delay length. (IDK what python has for controlling delays or to what granularity delay lengths can be specified.)\nMost of the other cues we have for spacial location are a lot harder to quantify. Most commonly we use volume, of course. Especially for higher-pitched content (wavelengths smaller than the width of the head) the head itself can block and cause some volume differences, based on the angle.\nBut a lot comes from reverberation for environmental cues, from timbrel roll-off as a function of distance (a quiet sound with lots of highs in the mix can really sound like they are right next to your ear), from moving the head to capture the sound from different angles, and from the filtering effects of the pinna of the ear. Because everyone's ear shape is different, I don't know that there is a universal thumbnail algorithm for what causes a sound to be sensed as originating from a particular altitude for a given angle. I think to some extent we just all learn by experiencing the sounds with our own particular ears while observing the sound source visually.",

    "answer": "Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, is a powerful ensemble Machine Learning technique that involves creating multiple subsets from a given dataset, training a different model on each subset, and then combining the predictions from these individual models to obtain a more robust prediction. Here are some crucial aspects, advanced strategies, applications, and clarifications about Bagging:\n\n**Advanced Techniques and Strategies:**\n\n- **Random Forests**: Random Forests is an extension of Bagging where multiple decision trees are constructed using different subsets of data and random subsets of features. It adds an additional layer of randomness, leading to improved predictive performance.\n- **Adaptive Bagging**: This technique assigns different weights to different subsets based on their performance, allowing the final prediction to be influenced more by the more reliable subsets.\n- **Stochastic Gradient Boosting**: Stochastic Gradient Boosting combines Bagging with Gradient Boosting, where each subsequent model is trained on a weighted version of the training data, with higher weights assigned to misclassified instances.\n\n**Cross-disciplinary Applications and Synergies:**\n\n- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Bagging is used in NLP tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions.\n- **Bioinformatics**: Bagging has applications in analyzing gene expression data, protein structure prediction, and disease diagnosis.\n- **Financial Forecasting**: Bagging is employed in financial forecasting models to enhance the reliability of predictions and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n\n**Common Misconceptions and Clarifications:**\n\n- **Bagging is only applicable to classification tasks**: While commonly used in classification, Bagging can also be applied to regression tasks to improve prediction accuracy.\n- **Bagging always improves model performance**: While generally true, Bagging may not always lead to performance improvements if the dataset is small or the base models are not diverse.",

I had a similar problem with matlab a while ago, and the way I solved it was to launch matlab with -singlecompthread, but I don't know what to do with python.\nIf it helps, I'm solving the Poisson equation (which is not parallelized at all) in my script.\n\nUPDATE:\nMy friend ran the code on his own computer and it only takes 100% cpu. I don't use any BLAS, MKL or any other thing. I still don't know what the cause for 400% cpu usage is.\nThere's a piece of fortran algorithm from the library SLATEC, which solves the Ax=b system. That part I think is using a lot of cpu.",
    "answer": "Could it be that your code uses SciPy or other numeric library for Python that is linked against Intel MKL or another vendor provided library that uses OpenMP? If the underlying C/C++ code is parallelised using OpenMP, you can limit it to a single thread by setting the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1:\nOMP_NUM_THREADS=1 python myscript.py\nIntel MKL for sure is parallel in many places (LAPACK, BLAS and FFT functions) if linked with the corresponding parallel driver (the default link behaviour) and by default starts as many compute threads as is the number of available CPU cores.",

    "answer": "You can't get smaller frequency bins to separate out close spectral peaks unless you use more (a longer amount of) data.\nYou can't just use a narrower filter because the transient response of such a filter will be longer than your data.\nYou can get smaller frequency bins that are just a smooth interpolation between nearby frequency bins, for instance to plot the spectrum on wider paper or at a higher dpi graphic resolution, by zero-padding the data and using a longer FFT.

I was having issues with short names of companies, and their trailing part like Pvt,Ltd. I have ran the same set with Excel Fuzzy lookup and was getting good results. I there a way that i can see how excel fuzzy lookup is coded and use the same implementation in python.",
    "answer": "The following is an excerpt from Microsoft Fuzzy Lookup Add-In for Excel, Readme.docx. I hope that helps.\n\nAdvanced Concepts\nFuzzy Lookup technology is based upon a very simple, yet flexible\n  measure of similarity between two records. Jaccard similarity  Fuzzy\n  Lookup uses Jaccard similarity, which is defined as the size of the\n  set intersection divided by the size of the set union for two sets of\n  objects. For example, the sets {a, b, c} and {a, c, d} have a Jaccard\n  similarity of 2/4 = 0.5 because the intersection is {a, c} and the\n  union is {a, b, c, d}. The more that the two sets have in common, the\n  closer the Jaccard similarity will be to 1.0. \nWeighted Jaccard similarity and tokenization of records  With Fuzzy\n  Lookup, you can assign weights to each item in a set and define the\n  weighted Jaccard similarity as the total weight of the intersection\n  divided by the total weight of the union. For the weighted sets {(a,\n  2), (b, 5), (c, 3)}, {(a, 2), (c, 3), (d, 7)}, the weighted Jaccard\n  similariyt is (2 + 3)/(2 + 3 + 5 +7) = 5/17 = .294. \nBecause Jaccard similarity is defined over sets, Fuzzy Lookup must\n  first convert data records to sets before it calculates the Jaccard\n  similarity. Fuzzy Lookup converts the data to sets using a Tokenizer.\n  For example, the record {“Jesper Aaberg”, “4567 Main Street”} might be\n  tokenized into the set, {“ Jesper”, “Aaberg”, “4567”, “Main”,\n  “Street”}. The default tokenizer is for English text, but one may\n  change the LocaleId property in Configure=>Global Settings to specify\n  tokenizers for other languages.\nToken weighting  Because not all tokens are of equal importance, Fuzzy\n  Lookup assigns weights to tokens. Tokens are assigned high weights if\n  they occur infrequently in a sample of records and low weights if they\n  occur frequently. For example, frequent words such as “Corporation”\n  might be given lower weight, while less frequent words such as\n  “Abracadabra” might be given a higher weight. One may override the\n  default token weights by supplying their own table of token weights.\nTransformations Transformations greatly increase the power of Jaccard\n  similarity by allowing tokens to be converted from one string to\n  another. For instance, one might know that the name “Bob” can be\n  converted to “Robert”; that “USA” is the same as “United States”; or\n  that “Missispi” is a misspelling of “Mississippi”. There are many\n  classes of such transformations that Fuzzy Lookup handles\n  automatically such as spelling mistakes (using Edit Transformations\n  described below), string prefixes, and string merge/split operations.\n  You can also specify a table containing your own custom\n  transformations.\nJaccard similarity under transformations  The Jaccard similarity under\n  transformations is the maximum Jaccard similarity between any two\n  transformations of each set. Given a set of transformation rules, all\n  possible transformations of the set are considered. For example, for\n  the sets {a, b, c} and {a, c, d} and the transformation rules {b=>d,\n  d=>e}, the Jaccard similarity is computed as follows: Variations of\n  {a, b, c}: {a, b, c}, {a, d, c} Variations of {a, c, d}: {a, c, d},\n  {a, c, e} Maximum Jaccard similarity between all pairs: J({a, b, c},\n  {a, c, d}) = 2/4 = 0.5 J({a, b, c}, {a, c, e}) = 2/4 = 0.5 J({a, d,\n  c}, {a, c, d}) = 3/3 = 1.0 J({a, d, c}, {a, c, e}) = 2/4 = 0.5 The\n  maximum is 1.0. Note: Weghted Jaccard similiary under transformations\n  is simply the maximum weighted Jaccard similarity across all pairs of\n  transformed sets. \nEdit distance  Edit distance is the total number of character\n  insertions, deletions, or substitutions that it takes to convert one\n  string to another. For example, the edit distance between “misissipi”\n  and “mississippi” is 2 because two character insertions are required.\n  One of the transformation providers that’s included with Fuzzy Lookup\n  is the EditTransformationProvider, which generates specific\n  transformations for each input record and creates a transformation\n  from the token to all words in its dictionary that are within a given\n  edit distance. The normalized edit distance is the edit distance\n  divided by the length of the input string. In the previous example,\n  the normalized edit distance is 2/9 = .222.",

In short, what I am trying to accomplish is to populate the total_fold_array with 5 individual folds, which each contain a number of rows from a dataset.\nAn example of the current_fold_array might be [A,B,C,D], so then ultimately, I have a total_fold_array which has 5 of those individual folds, which would look like [[A,B,C,D,],[A,B,B,C],[A,A,A,A],[B,C,D,D],[B,B,B,C]]\nHowever, this loop does not do that. Instead, it creates total_fold_array with the length of whatever the length of classes is (in this case 7), instead of having 5 folds within.\nMy code is below:\nI am currently getting a total_fold_array containing 7 items, when instead, it should contain 5. Each item within can have as many items as needed, but the total_fold_array should be 5 items long. I believe there is a logic bug in my code, and I am looking for some help. If I were to use a dataset with 5 classes, this works appropriately. \nPlease let me know if I need to make this clearer.",
    "answer": "Just before for a_class,a_class_weight in zip(classes, class_weights):, you're initializing total_fold_array to [].\nThat loop executes for exactly as many times as there are elements in classes.\nEach iteration of that loop appends a curr_fold_array to total_fold_array.\nThat is why, at the end of that loop, you have as many elements in total_fold_array, as there are in classes.\nYou've enclosed all of this in while count != 6:. That seems totally unnecessary -- I think that while loop will execute exactly once. You are returning from that function before the second iteration of that while loop can happen. My guess is that you introduced that while loop hoping that it would somehow limit the number of elements in total_fold_array to 5. But that's not going to happen, because, inside that while loop, the for loop grows total_fold_array to have 7 elements, and this happens in the very first iteration of the while loop.",

    "question": "I'm working with a company on a project to develop ML models for predictive maintenance. The data we have is a collection of log files. In each log file we have time series from sensors (Temperature, Pressure, MototSpeed,...) and a variable in which we record the faults occurred. The aim here is to build a model that will use the log files as its input (the time series) and to predict whether there will be a failure or not. For this I have some questions:\n1) What is the best model capable of doing this?\n2) What is the solution to deal with imbalanced data? In fact, for some kind of failures we don't have enough data. \nI tried to construct an RNN classifier using LSTM after transforming the time series to sub time series of a fixed length. The targets were 1 if there was a fault and 0 if not. The number of ones compared to the number of zeros is negligible. As a result, the model always predicted 0. What is the solution?",
    "answer": "Mohamed, for this problem you could actually start with traditional ML models (random forest, lightGBM, or anything of this nature). I recommend you focus on your features. For example you mentioned Pressure, MototSpeed. Look at some window of time going back. Calculate moving averages, min/max values in that same window, st.dev. To tackle this problem you will need to have a set of healthy features. Take a look at featuretools package. You can either use it or get some ideas what features can be created using time series data. Back to your questions.\n1) What is the best model capable of doing this? Traditional ML methods as mentioned above. You could also use deep learning models, but I would first start with easy models. Also if you do not have a lot of data I probably would not touch RNN models.\n2) What is the solution to deal with imbalanced data? You may want to oversample or undersample your data. For oversampling look at the SMOTE package.\nGood luck",

    "question": "I'm doing an opencv project which needs to detect a image on the screen, which will disappear after some time it shows up. It needs to save the most amount of frames possible while the image is showing, and stop when it disappears. I plan to use the data collected to do a ConvNet, so the more frames I can capture, the better.\nI was using template matching full-screen to search for the image and to identify when it disappears, but I was only capturing about 30% of the total frames, with the screen at 30FPS.  \nWanting to increase frame capture rate, I changed to searching full-screen with template matching until the image was found, and then the area for searching was reduced to the coordinates found of the image with a little margin, so the program could identify when the image disapeared using a lot less resources (because of a very smaller área to check if the image was still there). This allowed me to capture 60% of the frames.  \nHowever I want to know, can I do something else to allow me to optimize my program? I feel like doing template matching for every frame is overkill. Is object tracking better in this case, or it won't even work because the image disapears?\nPS: the image stays for about 7~10 seconds on the screen and takes about the same time to pop up again.",

    "question": "I just wondered why Pandas DataFrame class functions do not change their instance.\nFor example, if I use pd.DataFrame.rename(), dropn(), I need to update the instance by redefining it. However, if its class is list, you can delete an element by a pop() method without redefining it. The function changes its intrinsic instance.\nIs there a reason why pandas or numpy use this kind of style?\nCan you explain why this kind of styling is better or its advantages?",
    "answer": "Each class defines what changes can be done in-place and which can't, creating instead a new object.  The reasons are varied and can't be reduced to a few simple rules.\nThe underlying data structure of a list is designed for growth and shrinkage.  Even so some changes are cheaper than others.  append and pop at the end requires fewer changes of the data than addition or removal of items at the beginning or middle.  Even so, actions like blist = alist[1:] produce a new list.\ntuple is a variation on list that is immutable, and is widely used in the base Python for function arguments and packing/unpacking results.\nA numpy array has a fixed size. Like lists, individual values can be changed in-place, but growth requires making a new array (except for a limited use of resize).  numpy also has a view mechanism that makes a new array, but which shares underlying data.  This can be efficient, but has pitfalls for the unwary.\npandas is built on numpy, with indices and values stored in arrays.  As other answers show it often has a in-place option, but I suspect that doesn't actually reduce the work or run time.  We'd have to know a lot more about the change(s) and dataframe structure.\nUltimately we, SO posters, can't answer \"why\" questions authoritatively.  We can only give opinions based on knowledge and experience.  Most of us are not developers, and certainly not original developers.",

    "question": "I'm using Tensorflow to generate a transformation matrix for a set of input vectors (X) to target vectors (Y). To minimize the error between the transformed input and the target vector samples I'm using a gradient descent algorithm. Later on I want to use the generated matrix to transform vectors coming from the same source as the training input vectors so that they look like the corresponding target vectors. Linear regression, pretty much, but with 3-dimensional targets. \nI can assume that the input and target vectors are in cartesian space. Thus, the transformation matrix should consist of a rotation and a translation. I'm working solely with unit vectors, so I can also safely assume that there's no translation, only rotation. \nSo, in order to get a valid rotation matrix that I can turn into a rotation quaternion I understand that I have to make sure the matrix is orthogonal. \nThus, the question is, is it possible to give Tensorflow some kind of constraint so that the matrix it tries to converge to is guaranteed to be orthogonal? Can be a parameter, a mathematical constraint, a specific optimizer, whatever. I just need to make sure the algorithm converges to a valid rotation matrix.",
    "answer": "It should be possible.\nI see two solutions.\nIf you don't care that the transformation is a perfect rotation, you can take the matrix, adjust it to what you think it's a good matrix (make it a perfect rotation) then compute the difference between the one you like and the original and add it as a loss.  With this approach you can push the model to do what you want but the model might not converge on a perfect rotation, especially if a perfect rotation is not a very good solution.\nAnother approach is to start with a proper rotation matrix and train the parameters of the rotation. In this case you would have the x,y,z of the rotation axis and the amount of rotation. So declare these as variables, compute the rotation matrix and use that in your model. The operations are derivable so gradient descent should work, but depending on the data itself you might depend on the start position (so try a few times).\nHard to say which one will work best in your case, so it might be worth trying both.",

In my special case, f(t) = F'(t), i.e. a time derivative of a function F. Furthermore, F is 1-periodic. Hence, integrating the ODE over the interval [0, 1] should yield the starting position again. However, methods like solve_ivp from scipy.integrate do not respect this periodicity at all (I have tried all the possible methods like RK45, Radau, DOP853, LSODA).\nIs there a special ODE solver that respects such periodicity to a high degree of precision?",
    "answer": "All algorithms will suffer from precision loss anyway, so you will most likely never achieve exact periodicity. Nonetheless, you can also try to increase the precision of the integration by using the parameters \"atol\" and \"rtol\", which, roughly, will keep the error of the integration below (atol + rtol*y) at each time step.

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1000]\nQuantizing it to output range of e.g. 0-255 would result in loss of precision because of huge outlier 1000 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 will all become 0).\nHowever, it is important to keep precision for those values which are within several std from mean.\nThrowing away the outliers or replacing them with NaN is not acceptable.

    "answer": "I can think of 2 answers to your question.\n\nYou write \"huge outlier\". The term outlier suggest that this number does not really fit the data. If you really have evidence that this observation is not representative (say because the measurement device was broken temporarily), then I would omit this observation.\nAlternatively, such high values might occur because this variable can truly span a large range of outcomes (e.g. an income variable with Elon Musk in the sample). In this situation I would consider a transformation of the input, say take the logarithm of the numbers first. This would transform your list [1,2,3,4,5,1000] to [0,0.69,1.10,1.39,1.61,6.91]. These values are already closer together.\n\nHowever, regardless of choices 1 or 2, it is probably best to anyways compare the outcomes with and without this outlier.

I find the junction of those two cards and increase its value by 1. \nNow, I need to find the maximum value for 36 cards.\nBut, how?\nRandomly selecting cards is useless, there are 1.717391336 E+74 potential combinations. I've tried pulling out the lowest values and that reduces the set of potential combinations, but even at 100 cards you're talking about 1.977204582 E+27 potentials. \nThis has to have been solved by someone smarter than me - can ya'll point me in the right direction?",
    "answer": "As you pointed out already, the combinatorics are not on your side here.

You can also take a look at the history, to get a feeling for how often it happens that the best set from step x is caught up by another set in a step y > x.

    "answer": "Well I am no expert when it comes to machine learning but I do know the math behind it. What you are doing when you train a neural network you basicly find the local minima to the loss function. What this means is that the end result will heavily depend on the initial guess of all of the internal varaibles.\nUsually the variables are randomized as a initial estimation and you could therefore reach quite different results from running the training process multiple times.\nThat being said, from when I studied the subject I was told that you usually reach similar regardless of the initial guess of the parameters. However it is hard to say if 0.88 and 0.92 would be considered similar or not.\nHope this gives a somewhat possible answer to your question.\nAs mentioned in another answer, you could remove the randomization, both in the parameter initialization of the parameters and the randomization of the data used for each epoch of training by introducing a seed.

When I ran both, Version 1 gave me a  validation mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0013, while Version 2 gave me 0.0015. This means Version 1 is a better model. But when I ran model.evaluate(X_test,y_test) with the test dataframe, Version gave me an MSE value of 0.0027 while Version 2 gave me 0.0018.\nMy question is which version is considered better, the version which gives a better Validation MSE or the model that gave a lower MSE when using the Test dataframe for predicting\nThank you.",
    "answer": "First of all, you can not cheat on the test set, and choose the model so that it gives the best results on the test. Validation is meant to be used for that intention, and the test is only there to check validation and test are getting along each other.\nYou did not mention the size of the training, validation, and test. The size of the data you use is very important to be as big enough to represent the real distribution of the data, in training, validation, and the test.\nOn the other hand, the way you sample the data should be done in a way, that three sets have the same distribution. \nLast, by not least, you are comparing two results which differ about 0.0002 in MSE. I do not believe it gives you good judgment on which one is better.",

    "question": "I've been searching for a bit now and haven't been able to find anything similar to my question. Maybe i'm just not searching correctly. Anyways this is a question from my exam review. Given a binary tree, I need to output a list such that each item in the list is the number of nodes on a level in a binary tree at the items list index. What I mean, lst = [1,2,1] and the 0th index is the 0th level in the tree and the 1 is how many nodes are in that level. lst[1] will represent the number of nodes (2) in that binary tree at level 1. The tree isn't guaranteed to be balanced. We've only been taught preorder,inorder and postorder traversals, and I don't see how they would be useful in this question. I'm not asking for specific code, just an idea on how I could figure this out or the logic behind it. Any help is appreciated.",
    "answer": "The search ordering doesn't really matter as long as you only count each node once. A depth-first search solution with recursion would be:\n\nCreate a map counters to store a counter for each level. E.g. counters[i] is the number of nodes found so far at level i. Let's say level 0 is the root.\nDefine a recursive function count_subtree(node, level): Increment counters[level] once. Then for each child of the given node, call count_subtree(child, level + 1) (the child is at a 1-deeper level).\nCall count_subtree(root_node, 0) to count starting at the root. This will result in count_subtree being run exactly once on each node because each node only has one parent, so counters[level] will be incremented once per node. A leaf node is the base case (no children to call the recursive function on).\nBuild your final list from the values of counters, ordered by their keys ascending.\n\nThis would work with any kind of tree, not just binary. Running time is O(number of nodes in tree). Side note: The depth-first search solution would be easier to divide and run on parallel processors or machines than a similar breadth-first search solution.",

(the elements can be in {1,2,3})\nFor example:\n1311212323 -> 1111222333 (#swaps: 2)\nAlready found similar questions on Stackoverflow, however, we have new information about the upper limit, that can be useful in the algorithm.",
    "answer": "Yes, the upper limit of 3 makes a big difference.\nLet w(i, j) be the number of positions that contain i that should contain j. To find the optimal number of swaps, let w'(i, j) = w(i, j) - min(w(i, j), w(j, i)). The answer is (sum over i<j of min(w(i, j), w(j, i))) + (2/3) (sum over i!=j of w'(i, j)).\nThat this answer is an upper bound follows from the following greedy algorithm: if there are i!=j such that w(i, j) > 0 and w(j, i) > 0, then we can swap an appropriate i and j, costing us one swap but also lowering the bound by one. Otherwise, swap any two out of place elements. The first term of the answer goes up by one, and the second goes down by two. (I am implicitly invoking induction here.)\nThat this answer is a lower bound follows from the fact that no swap can decrease it by more than one. This follows from more tedious case analysis.\nThe reason that this answer doesn't generalize past (much past?) 3 is that the cycle structure gets more complicated. Still, for array entries bounded by k, there should be an algorithm whose exponential dependence is limited to k, with a polynomial dependence on n, the length of the arrays.",

However, simply setting seed \"random.seed(55)\" does not appear to work, changing the original code \"from random import ....\" to \"import random\" doesn't help, nor does changing Random().  These all seem to do approximately the same thing, the trees start out building the same, then diverge.\nIn reading various entries about the behavior of random, I can find no reason, given his GP code, why this divergence should happen.  There doesn't appear to be anything in the code except calls to random, that has any variability that would account for this behavior.  My understanding is that calling random.seed() should set all the calls correctly and since the code isn't threaded at all, I'm not sure how or why the divergence is happening.\nHas anyone modified this code to behave reproducibly? Is there some form of calling random.seed() that may work better?\nI apologize for not posting an example, but the code is obviously not mine (I'm adding only the call to seed and changing how random is called in the code) and this doesn't appear to be a simple issue with random (I've read all the entries on Python random here and many on the web in general).\nThanks.\nMark L.",

    "answer": "**Definition of Music Information Retrieval (MIR)**\n\nMusic Information Retrieval (MIR) is a multidisciplinary field that involves the use of computers to analyze, organize, and retrieve music data. It focuses on developing techniques for representing, indexing, searching, and classifying music, enabling efficient and effective access to music collections and information. MIR incorporates knowledge from various areas such as signal processing, machine learning, data mining, and music theory.\n\n**Real-World Application Examples of MIR:**\n\n* **Music Recommendation Systems:** MIR algorithms are used in music streaming services to make personalized recommendations based on user preferences, listening history, and music characteristics such as genre, mood, and rhythm.\n\n* **Music Search Engines:** MIR enables users to search for music using various criteria, including melody, lyrics, instrumentation, or similarity to a reference track.\n\n* **Automatic Music Transcription:** MIR systems can automatically transcribe music recordings into sheet music or MIDI files, providing valuable resources for musicians and researchers.\n\n**Advanced Techniques and Strategies:**\n\n* **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques are widely used in MIR tasks such as genre classification, mood analysis, and music similarity calculation.\n\n* **Signal Processing Techniques:** Advanced signal processing methods, such as time-frequency analysis and spectral features extraction, provide insights into the musical structure and characteristics.\n\n* **Natural Language Processing:** MIR systems can process music-related text data, such as lyrics, reviews, and social media posts, to enhance music understanding and discovery.\n\n**Historical Developments and Future Trends:**\n\n* **Early MIR Research:** MIR research began in the 1960s, focusing on melody recognition and database retrieval. In the 1990s, research expanded to include timbre analysis, music structure modeling, and content-based music search.\n\n* **Current Trends:** Current research directions include deep learning for MIR, cross-modal retrieval (e.g., linking music to images or text), and using MIR techniques for music production and composition.\n\n* **Future Directions:** Future MIR research is expected to explore novel applications in music education, therapeutic music applications, and the integration of MIR with other technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality.",

    "question": "I don't know that much about vectorization, but I am interested in understanding why a language like python can not provide vectorization on iterables through a library interface, much like it provides threading support. I am aware that many numpy methods are vectorized, but it can be limiting to have to work with numpy for generic computations.\nMy current understanding is that python is not capable of vectorizing functions even if they match the \"SIMD\" pattern. For instance, in theory shouldn't any list comprehension or use of the map() function be vectorizable because they output a list which is the result of running the same function on independent inputs from an input list? \nWith my niave understanding, it seems that anytime I use map(), in theory, I should be able to create an instruction set that represents the function; then each element in the input just needs to be run through the same function that was compiled. What is the technical challenge to designing a tool that provides simd_map(func, iterable), which attempts to compile func \"just in time\" and then grabs batches of input from iterable and utilizes the processor's simd capabilities to run those batches through func()?\nThanks!",
    "answer": "You want vectorization or JIT compilation use numba, pypy or cython but be warned the speed comes at the cost of flexibility. \nnumba is a python module that will jit compile certain functions for you but it does not support many kinds of input and barfs on some (many) python constructs. It is really fast when it works but can be difficult to wrangle. It is also very targeted at working with numpy arrays.\npypy is a complete replacement for the cpython interpreter that is a JIT. It supports the entire python spec but does not integrate with extensions well so some libraries will not work.\ncython is an extension of python which compiles to a binary which will behave like a python module. However it does require you to use special syntax to take advantage of the speed gains and requires you to explicitly declare things as ctypes to real get any advantage.\nMy recommendation is:\nuse pypy if you are pure python. (if it works for you it's basically effortless)\nUse numba if you need to speed up numeric calculations that numpy doesn't have a good way to do.\nUse cython if you need the speed and the other 2 don't work.",

Because each of these files do not represent a single sample, but rather a variable number of samples, the dataset I require can only be formed by iterating through each of these files and concatenating/appending them to a single, unified array. With this being said, I unfortunately cannot avoid having to iterate through such files in order to form the dataset I require. As such, the process of data loading prior to model training is very slow.\nTherefore my question is this: would it be better to merge these small files together into relatively larger files, e.g., reducing the 300,000 files to 300 (merged) files?

It involves normalizing the activations of each layer by subtracting the batch mean and dividing by the batch standard deviation.\n\n**Real-world Applications:**\n\n* **Improved Training Stability:** Batch Normalization helps training by reducing the internal covariate shift, the change in distribution of activations within a layer during training. This leads to faster and more stable convergence.\n\n* **Faster Convergence:** By normalizing activations, Batch Normalization helps the network learn more independently of the scale of inputs. This results in faster convergence and reduced training time.\n\n* **Regularization:** Batch Normalization acts as a regularizer, reducing overfitting by introducing noise and preventing the network from overly relying on specific features. This can improve generalization performance.\n\n* **Reduced Sensitivity to Initialization:** Batch Normalization makes the network less sensitive to the initialization of weights, allowing for more robust training and better performance with different initializations.\n\n* **Example:** In image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Batch Normalization has been shown to improve accuracy and reduce training time, making it a crucial technique in computer vision tasks.",

    "question": "Hi there, could you elaborate on how dimensionality reduction can be useful in practice? What are some real world use cases and the challenges that have been overcome in implementing these use cases?",
    "answer": "Dimensionality reduction, a data preprocessing technique frequently used in machine learning and data analysis, excels at capturing essential information while discarding redundant data. Its versatility shines in a variety of domains, including:\n\n- **Text Mining**: Dimensionality reduction aids in text analysis by recognizing latent semantic patterns within large text datasets. A popular technique, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), unlocks insights from vast text corpora, transforming unstructured data into a more usable format.\n\n- **Image Processing**: Dimensionality reduction breathes new life into image data, unlocking valuable insights. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) takes center stage here, reducing image dimensions while preserving critical features. This streamlined representation proves invaluable for tasks such as facial recognition and object detection.\n\n- **Natural Language Processing**: Embeddings, a type of dimensionality reduction, revolutionize natural language processing, paving the way for machines to grasp the intricate relationships between words. Word2Vec and GloVe stand out, providing vector representations for words that capture their semantic and syntactic properties. These representations elevate tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering.\n\nChallenges aren't foreign to dimensionality reduction, but researchers have risen to the occasion with innovative solutions:\n\n- **Curse of Dimensionality**: As dimensionality increases, data becomes sparser, making it harder to analyze effectively. Sampling techniques like Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and Random Projections (RP) resolve this issue, efficiently extracting meaningful information from high-dimensional data.\n\n- **Information Loss**: Dimensionality reduction, by its nature, may lead to some information loss. Striking an optimal balance is key, and manifold learning algorithms like t-SNE and UMAP step up, preserving local relationships while reducing dimensionality, minimizing information loss.\n\n- **Interpretability**: Dimensionality reduction techniques can sometimes make data less interpretable. Explainable AI (XAI) methods like LIME and SHAP come to the rescue, unraveling the inner workings of dimensionality reduction algorithms, fostering better understanding and trust in the results.\n\nDimensionality reduction has transformed industries, empowering us to derive meaningful insights from complex data. Its impact is far-reaching, enabling advancements in fields as diverse as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing.",

This is equivalent to sum over the upper triangular elements of a matrix, diagonal excluded.\nGiven A a symmetric N x N array, the simplest solution is np.triu(A,1).sum() however I was wondering if faster methods exist that require less memory.\nIt seems that (A.sum() - np.diag(A).sum())/2 is faster on large array, but how to avoid creating even the N x 1 array from np.diag?\nA doubly nested for loop would require no additional memory, but it is clearly not the way to go in Python.",
    "answer": "The fastest method with the least memory, in pure numpy is going to be to sum the entire thing and subtract the diagonal.\nIt may feel wasteful in terms of FLOPS, but note that the theoretical savings relative to that implementation are only a factor 2. If that means anything to you, you probably should not be using numpy in the first place. \nAlso, numpy fundamentally deals with blocks of memory addressable as strided views. If you could get a single strided view onto your triangle, it might lead to an efficient numpy implementation. But you cant (proof left as exercise to the reader), so you can safely forget about any true numpy solution that isnt a call to an optimized C-routine that solves your problem for you. And none exist that I am aware.\nBut even that 'optimized' C loop may in practice get its ass kicked by A.sum(). If A is contiguous, that sum has the potential to dispatch a maximally cache-optimized and SIMD-optimized codepath. Likely, any vanilly-C youd write yourself would get absolutely demolished by A.sum() in a benchmark.",

    "answer": "**Understanding Multi-Label Classification:**\n\nMulti-label classification is a supervised machine learning task where each data instance can be associated with multiple labels. Unlike traditional single-label classification, multi-label models predict a set of relevant labels for each input.\n\n**Complexities and Challenges:**\n\n1. **Label Correlation:** Labels in multi-label data are often correlated, making it challenging to model their dependencies.\n2. **Imbalanced Label Distribution:** Multi-label datasets often have an uneven distribution of labels, leading to bias in model predictions.\n3. **High Dimensionality:** The output space of multi-label classification can be exponentially larger than that of single-label classification.\n\n**Innovative Methodologies:**\n\nResearchers have developed various techniques to address the complexities of multi-label classification, including:\n\n- **Tree-Based Methods (e.g., Random Forest-MLC, CLTree):** Utilize decision trees to capture label dependencies and handle missing values.\n- **Neural Networks (e.g., ML-CNN, MLaaS):** Leverage deep learning architectures to model complex label relationships and extract hierarchical features.\n- **Ensemble Techniques:** Combine multiple classifiers to improve generalization and robustness.\n\n**Recent Breakthroughs:**\n\n- **Transfer Learning:** Pre-trained models from image recognition or natural language processing tasks are utilized to enhance multi-label classification performance.\n- **Few-Shot Learning:** Enables models to generalize to new labels with limited labeled data by exploiting meta-learning techniques.\n- **Graph Neural Networks:** Capture the structural relationships between labels and input features using graph-based representations, enhancing model interpretability.\n\n**Comparative Analysis:**\n\nMulti-label classification differs from related concepts such as:\n\n- **Multi-Class Classification:** Assigns a single class label to each instance, while multi-label classification predicts multiple labels.\n- **Binary Relevance:** Treats each label as an independent binary classification problem, ignoring label correlations.\n\nMulti-label classification is a powerful technique with applications in various fields, including image annotation, text categorization, and disease diagnosis.",

I had both versions on my computer, and tried to uninstall all the 11.1 toolkit using the Windows add/remove tool (which is recommended). This seemed to work in removing 11.1, however, when I try to re-install the TensorFlow package into the Project Interpreter Setting (within PyCharm) it comes up with the following error:\n\n\nUnsatisfiableError: The following specifications were found to be incompatible with the existing python installation in your\nenvironment:\nSpecifications:\ntensorflow -> python[version='3.5.|3.6.|3.7.*']\nYour python: python=3.8\nIf python is on the left-most side of the chain, that's the version you've asked for.

Now I want to find a way to divide that number into 596 cities of Germany based on the GDP per capita of each city and consumer spending of each city. So after that I can have the beer revenue of each single city in Germany.\nMy assumption is: city beer = city consumer spending * x + city GDP per cap * y. and then sum of city beer = national beer\nCould you please advice which kind of algorithm or a way to do it in Python?\nThank you so much.",
    "answer": "Your assumption is not so good. Some cities may spend a bigger fraction of their total consumation in beer.\nI think a better assumption is that it's a variable fraction of the total consumation in beer, let's say, city i consumes a fraction xi of national consumation in beer, where xi is somehow dependent on the GDP and on the city consumation.\nTo find xi, firstly scale the GDP to be in [delta, 1-delta], where delta is a positive quantity very close to zero, and keep their relative order. To do that, consider the biggest GDP is GDPmax and the minimum GDP is GDPmin. Then, map each GDPi to\nscaleGDPi = [(GDPi - GDPmin) * (1 - 2 * delta)/(GDPmax-GDPmin)] + delta.\nIn a similar way, also scale the consumation to be in [delta, 1 - delta].\nThen, consider xi = scaleGDPi * scaleConsumationi * x and you get (city beer)i = scaleGDPi * scaleConsumationi * x * national beer\nBy imposing that the sum of city beer is equal to national beer, you get:\nx = 1 / (sum scaleGDPi * scaleConsumationi).\nSo, city beer = (scaleGDPi * scaleConsumationi * national beer)/(sum scaleGDPi * scaleConsumationi).\nI think this would be a more adequate modelization of your problem.",

    "answer": "**Definition and Overview of Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**\n\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) is a subfield of machine learning that explores and automates the design of neural network architectures - the blueprint of a deep learning model. Traditionally, designing neural network architectures was done manually by human experts, but NAS empowers us to automate this often complex and time-consuming process.\n\nNAS involves using optimization algorithms and machine learning techniques to search through a vast space of possible neural network architectures, with the aim of finding architectures that achieve optimal performance on a given task.\n\n**Historical Developments in NAS**\n\n- **Early Efforts (1990s - 2000s):** Initial attempts in NAS focused on using evolutionary algorithms to optimize neural network architectures. A significant milestone was the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm, which used genetic programming to evolve neural network architectures.\n\n- **Emergence of Reinforcement Learning (2010s):** The incorporation of reinforcement learning into NAS brought about substantial advancements. Reinforcement learning algorithms like Q-learning and policy gradients enabled more effective exploration of the search space and led to the discovery of improved architectures.\n\n- **Recent Advances (2020s):** Current research in NAS emphasizes leveraging advances in machine learning, such as Bayesian optimization, transfer learning, and differentiable architecture search, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of NAS algorithms.\n\n**Comparative Analysis of NAS with Similar Concepts**\n\n- **AutoML (Automated Machine Learning):** NAS is a specific domain within AutoML, focusing solely on automating the design of neural network architectures. AutoML encompasses broader aspects of automating machine learning processes, including feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** While NAS optimizes the architecture of a neural network, hyperparameter optimization focuses on adjusting the values of predefined hyperparameters, such as learning rate and dropout rate, within a given architecture.\n\n- **Architecture Pruning:** Architecture pruning involves removing redundant or less important connections from a neural network to reduce its size and complexity. NAS, on the other hand, optimizes the architecture by searching for the optimal topology and number of connections.\n\n**Regulatory and Legal Implications of NAS**\n\nAs NAS becomes increasingly prevalent, regulatory and legal implications arise, including:\n\n- **Intellectual Property (IP) Ownership:** Determining who owns or has rights to NAS-generated architectures can be complex, especially in collaborative research settings or when using open-source software frameworks.\n\n- **Model Bias and Fairness:** NAS algorithms must be developed with considerations for potential biases or unfairness that could be introduced into the resulting neural network architectures.\n\n- **Accountability and Liability:** As NAS-designed neural networks are increasingly deployed in critical applications, the question of accountability and liability in case of model failures or errors becomes relevant.",

    "answer": "Depends on what you want to do. Do you want to multiply every item in the list self.cashflow[\"Balance\"] with self.assumptions[\"Default Rates\"][current_period - 1]? Then you can use some list comprehension:\nresult = [q * self.assumptions[\"Default Rates\"][current_period - 1] for q in self.cashflow[\"Balance\"]]\nor convert your second argument to np.float:\nresult = self.assumptions[\"Default Rates\"][current_period - 1]* np.asarray(self.cashflow[\"Balance\"])\nOtherwise, multiplying a whole list by N repeats that list N times. If thats what you want, cast your np.float64 to int.\nEDIT: Added missing multiplication sign",

    "question": "Describe the mechanism of gradient descent in the context of machine learning.",
    "answer": "Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the error of a model by adjusting its parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the error function. By computing the gradient of the error with respect to each parameter, the algorithm updates the parameters in small steps, converging towards the optimal values that minimize the error. This process continues until the algorithm reaches a predefined stopping criterion or convergence criteria, effectively optimizing the model's parameters for improved performance.",

    "question": "We have an experiment we are running where subjects play a video game and we record various data related to the gameplay. While the game is playing, we make a screen capture of the gameplay. One of the data we capture is when they push a button to request information during the game.\nWe are trying to understand if there are conditions related to lighting, decision points, etc. that are causing the button to be pushed. Ultimately the goal is to build a predictive model that will present the data before the subject asks for it.\nMy question is what is the best approach to analyze the video vs. the button push for information? We have timestamped csv files with the button push data and a video of the gameplay. Originally I thought of using Matlab to do the analysis, but I couldn't find a good example of how to approach the problem. I have a couple folks skilled at python on the team that I could ask for help as well, but I had wanted to see if I could understand what needed to be done before tasking them to do it.\nAny help is appreciated!\nThanks",
    "answer": "I think it is best if you consult a professional data scientist. However, I can think of one way to approach your problem.\nBecause a video is what data scientists call unstructured data, you'll have a hard time analyzing it raw.\nWhat I would do is to define some key points during the gameplay (ie. beginning of a new level or confronting a new puzzle), create a time interval around that key point, and chart the button pushed based on these intervals.\nConsider a set of gameplay videos with 2 key points. For example, the key point in one of the videos is set in times 04:13 and 32:00. So the video's timeline should look something like this.\n\n(Begining) 00:00 --------> 04:13 --------> 32:00 --------> 45:00 (End)\n\nNow for each key point, define a time interval of say, 2 minutes and record if the button is pushed in the obtained time intervals. So for key point number one, you will have 02:13 until 06:13. After doing so for every video and adding up all the data obtained, You'll end up with a table like below:\n\n\n\n\nTime Intervals\nTime interval for 1 player\n#Buttons Pushed\n\n\n\n\nInterval No.1\n00:00 - 02:13\n5\n\n\nKey Point No.1\n02:13 - 06:13\n19\n\n\nInterval No.3\n06:13 - 30:00\n7\n\n\nKey Point No.2\n30:00 - 34:00\n25\n\n\nInterval No.4\n34:00 - 45:00\n9\n\n\n\n\nThis basically means that for example, 7 people pushed the button during the time interval no.3 which in the above example (for that one player) is around times 06:13 - 30:00.\nAfter doing a small binary classification on the obtained data set, you'll end up with two classes for each key point, High Number of Buttons Pushed and Low Number of Buttons Pushed.\nNow add a listener to your game code and determine when the player enters a new KeyPoint. Use a simple search algorithm to find that if the KeyPoint is in the first class High Number of Buttons Pushed or in the second class, Low Number of Buttons Pushed. If it was in the first class, suggest pressing the key if not pass.",

For this kind of task we want a metric that rewards us for getting lots of “correct” or relevant recommendations, and rewards us for having them earlier on in the list (higher ranked).

    "answer": "Answers:\n\nperhaps, read-on\n\"cross-validation\" tests like MAP@k require that the data is split into \"test\" and \"training\" data. save 20% of the data for the \"test\" part then train the model on the rest. For the \"test\" set get a hashtag and make the query of the model. For every time the query returns a tag associated with the \"test\" datum you have a positive result. This allows you to calculate MAP@k. You can perform subsequent splits to use all data and combine the results but this is usually not necessary.\nthere is no fixed \"good\" for MAP@k. Find MAP@k for a random dataset as well as using your dataset to create \"popular\" hashtags. Using random and popular tags will give you 2 more MAP@k results. These should be significantly lower that the recommender MAP@k. Also the MAP@k for recs can be used as a baseline for future improvements, like changes to word embeddings. Better than the baseline means you have have a better recommender.\nresults with humans are the best metric since a recommender is trying to guess what humans are interested in. This requires an A/B test for 2 variants, like random and recs -- or no recs and recs. Set your test up with where the app has no recs or random recs. This will be the \"A\" part and the \"B\" will be using your recs. If you get significantly more clicks using \"B\" you have clearly improved results for you app -- this assumes your app considers more clicks to the the thing to optimize. If you want to optimize time-on-site, then replace your metric for the A/B test.",

I was using Legendre polynomial, but for > 20 points it gives not exact values. I can write chi2 test, but algorithm needs a loot of time to calculate N parameters, and at the beginning I don't know how the function looks like, so it takes time. I was thinking about splines... Maybe ...\nSo the input is: 3000 pints\nOutput         : f(x) = ... something\nI want to have a formula from fit. What is a best way to do this in python?\nLet the force would be with us!\nNykon",
    "answer": "Except, a spline does not give you a \"formula\", at least not unless you have the wherewithal to deal with all of the piecewise segments. Even then, it will not be easily written down, or give you anything that is at all pretty to look at.\nA simple spline gives you an interpolant. Worse, for 3000 points, an interpolating spline will give you roughly that many cubic segments! You did say interpolation before. OF course, an interpolating polynomial of that high an order will be complete crapola anyway, so don't think you can just go back there.\nIf all that you need is a tool that can provide an exact interpolation at any point, and you really don't need to have an explicit formula, then an interpolating spline is a good choice.\nOr do you really want an approximant? A function that will APPROXIMATELY fit your data, smoothing out any noise? The fact is, a lot of the time when people who have no idea what they are doing say \"interpolation\" they really do mean approximation, smoothing. This is possible of course, but there are entire books written on the subject of curve fitting, the modeling of empirical data. You first goal is then to choose an intelligent model, that will represent this data. Best of course is if you have some intelligent choice of model from physical understanding of the relationship under study, then you can estimate the parameters of that model using a nonlinear regression scheme, of which there are many to be found.\nIf you have no model, and are unwilling to choose one that roughly has the proper shape, then you are left with generic models in the form of splines, which can be fit in a regression sense, or with high order polynomial models, for which I have little respect.\nMy point in all of this is YOU need to make some choices and do some research on a choice of model.",

    "answer": "You can get the same results with both. LassoCV makes it easier by letting you pass an array of alpha-values to alphas as well as a cross validation parameter directly into the classifier.\nTo do the same thing with GridSearchCV, you would have to pass it a Lasso classifier a grid of alpha-values (i.e. {'alpha':[.5, 1, 5]}) and the CV parameter.\nI would not recommend one over the other though. The only advantage I can see is that you can access results_ as well as many other attributes if you use GridSearchCV. This may be helpful if you want a summary of all the models returned by the alphas you tried. On the other hand, as pointed out by @amiola, LassoCV can take advantage of using pre-computed results in previous steps of the cross-validation process (aka warm-starting), which may result in faster fitting times.",

It's a straightforward attribute.\nBy comparison, .info() and .describe() both apply filtering/formatting etc to the data before it is returned. You can also optionally pass them parameters to specify how the data is filtered/formatted before it is returned to you.\nThere are other reasons why attributes might be accessed through functions, such as using getters and setters to access protected attributes, but in your present examples it's because the functions don't just return the data, they do something to the data first.",

One of the two is the one given to the driver to store episodes and then rb.as_dataset(single_determinsitic_pass=true) is used to get the appropriate items to place in the memory of the second one used for training. The only thing you need to checkpoint of course is the first one.\nNote: I'm not sure off-the-top-of-my head how exactly single_determinsitic_pass works, you may want to check that in order to determine which portion of the returned dataset corresponds to the day you want to train from. I also have the suspicion that probably the portion corresponding to the last day shifts, because if I don't remember wrong the RB table that stores the experiences works with a cursor that once reached the maximum length starts overwriting from the beginning.\nNeither RB needs to know about the logic of how many prediction runs there are, in the end your code should manage that logic and you might want to keep track (maybe in a pickle if you want to save this) how many predictions correspond to each day so that you know which ones to pick.",

For a lot of my queries the data loading is the majority of the response times. The datasets are optimized parquet files (categories instead of strings, etc) which only reads the columns it needs. \nCurrently I use a naive approach that per-requests loads the require dataset (reading the 10-20 columns out of 1000 I need from the dataset) and then filter out the rows I need. \nA typical request:\n\nRead and parse the contract (~50-100ms)    \nLoad the dataset (10-20 columns) (400-1200ms)    \nExecute pandas operations (~50-100ms)\nSerialise the results (50-100ms)\n\nI'm now trying to speed this up (reduce or remove the load dataset step). \nThings I have tried:\n\nUse Arrow's new row-level filtering on the dataset to only read the rows I need as well. This is probably a good way in the future, but for now the new Arrow Dataset API which is relies on is significantly slower than reading the full file using the legacy loader. \nOptimize the hell out of the datasets. This works well to a point, where things are in categories, the data types is optimized. \nStore the dataframe in Ray. Using ray.put and ray.get. However this doesn't actually improve the situation since the time consuming part is deserialization of the dataframe. \nPut the dataset in ramfs. This doesn't actually improve the situation since the time consuming part is deserialization of the dataframe.\nStore the object in another Plasma store (outside of ray.put) but obviously the speed is the same (even though I might get some other benefits)\n\nThe datasets are parquet files, which is already pretty fast for serialization/deserialization. I typically select about 10-20 columns (out of 1000) and about 30-60% of the rows. \nAny good ideas on how to speed up the loading? I haven't been able to find any near zero-copy operations for pandas dataframes (i.e without the serialization penalty). \nThings that I am thinking about:\n\nPlacing the dataset in an actor, and use one actor per thread. That would probably give the actor direct access to the dataframe without any serialization, but would require me to do a lot of handling of:\n\nMaking sure I have an actor per thread\nDistribute requests per threads\n\"Recycle\" the actors when the dataset gets updated\n\n\nRegards,\nNiklas",

I have a dataset of 300k documents with an average of 560 words (no stop word removal yet) 75% in German, 15% in English and the rest in different languages. The goal is to recommend similar documents based on an existing one. At the beginning I want to focus on the German and English documents.  \nTo achieve this goal I looked into several methods on feature extraction for document similarity, especially the word embedding methods have impressed me because they are context aware in contrast to simple TF-IDF feature extraction and the calculation of cosine similarity. \nI'm overwhelmed by the amount of methods I could use and I haven't found a proper evaluation of those methods yet. I know for sure that the size of my documents are too big for BERT, but there is FastText, Sent2Vec, Doc2Vec and the Universal Sentence Encoder from Google. My favorite method based on my research is Doc2Vec even though there aren't any or old pre-trained models which means I have to do the training on my own.\nNow that you know my task and goal, I have the following questions:\n\nWhich method should I use for feature extraction based on the rough overview of my data?\nMy dataset is too small to train Doc2Vec on it. Do I achieve good results if I train the model on English / German Wikipedia?",
    "answer": "You really have to try the different methods on your data, with your specific user tasks, with your time/resources budget to know which makes sense.\nYou 225K German documents and 45k English documents are each plausibly large enough to use Doc2Vec - as they match or exceed some published results. So you wouldn't necessarily need to add training on something else (like Wikipedia) instead, and whether adding that to your data would help or hurt is another thing you'd need to determine experimentally.\n(There might be special challenges in German given compound words using common-enough roots but being individually rare, I'm not sure. FastText-based approaches that use word-fragments might be helpful, but I don't know a Doc2Vec-like algorithm that necessarily uses that same char-ngrams trick. The closest that might be possible is to use Facebook FastText's supervised mode, with a rich set of meaningful known-labels to bootstrap better text vectors - but that's highly speculative and that mode isn't supported in Gensim.)",

Is it slicing the 1D array?\n\nnb.types.NPDatetime('M') is a Numpy datetime type (where 'M' is meant to specify the granularity of the datetime. eg. months) here and [::1] means that this is a 1D contiguous array (containing datetime objects).\nOne should not be confused between object instances and object types.

In other words, I would like to automatically mix both y sets to produce a new ideal one.\nSay, for instance, biological activity. Different experiments and different databases provide different values.

However, I have thousands of rows and cannot read thousands of papers.\nSo I would like to know if there is an algorithm that, for instance, would use 3 as a base for the true y values but would pick values from 4 when the model improves by so doing.\nIt would be useful it it would report the final y column and be able to use more than 2, but I think I can figure out that.\nThe idea now is to find out if there is already a solution out there so that I don't need to reinvent the wheel.\nBest,\nMiro\nNOTE: The features (x) are in a different file.",

I've tried reshaping, resizing, inserting, concatenating and a bunch of other methods to no avail!\nWould really appreciate some help! TIA!",
    "answer": "It seems like you might have misunderstood how numpy arrays work or how they should be used.\nEach dimension(except for the inner most dimension) of a an array is essentially just an array of arrays. So for your example with dimension (60000, 28, 28). You have an array with 60000 arrays, which in turn are arrays with 28 arrays. The final array are then a array of 28 objects of some sort.(Integers in the mnist dataset I think).\nYou can convert this into a (60000, 28, 28, 1) by using numpys expand_dims method like so:\nnew_array = numpy.expand_dims(original_array, axis=-1)\nHowever, this will only make the last array be an array of 1 objects, and will not include the other array in any way.\nFrom what I can read from your question it seems like you want to map the labels of the mnist dataset with the corresponding image. You could do this by making the object of the outermost dimension a tuple of(image<28x28 numpy array>, label<int>), but this would remove the numpy functionality of the array. The best course of action is probably to keep it as is and using the index of an image to check the label.",

It seems to be step 4 that's taking up most of the time.  For the most part, I'd like to optimize this for handling a set of records in the low millions running on a quad-core server with a RAID setup of some kind.\nThere are a few ideas that I have to solve this:\n\nRead the entire file from step one (or at least read it in very large chunks) and write the file to disk as a whole or in very large chunks.  The idea being that the hard disk would spend less time going back and forth between files.  Would this do anything that buffering wouldn't?\nParallelize steps 1, 2&3, and 4 into separate processes.  This would make steps 1, 2, and 3 not have to wait on 4 to complete.\nBreak the load file up into separate chunks and process them in parallel.  The rows don't need to be handled in any sequential order.  This would likely need to be combined with step 2 somehow.\n\nOf course, the correct answer to this question is \"do what you find to be the fastest by testing.\"  However, I'm mainly trying to get an idea of where I should spend my time first.  Does anyone with more experience in these matters have any advice?",
    "answer": "Python already does IO buffering and the OS should handle both prefetching the input file and delaying writes until it needs the RAM for something else or just gets uneasy about having dirty data in RAM for too long.  Unless you force the OS to write them immediately, like closing the file after each write or opening the file in O_SYNC mode.\nIf the OS isn't doing the right thing, you can try raising the buffer size (third parameter to open()). For some guidance on appropriate values given a 100MB/s 10ms latency IO system a 1MB IO size will result in approximately 50% latency overhead, while a 10MB IO size will result in 9% overhead. If its still IO bound, you probably just need more bandwidth. Use your OS specific tools to check what kind of bandwidth you are getting to/from the disks.\nAlso useful is to check if step 4 is taking a lot of time executing or waiting on IO. If it's executing you'll need to spend more time checking which part is the culprit and optimize that, or split out the work to different processes.",

I also know what the output Y should be for all of my data. \nSo far I have done a simple grid search in python, looping through all of the possible parameter combinations and returning those results where the error between Y predicted and Y observed is within a set limit.  \nI then look at the results to see which set of parameters performs best for each group of samples, look at the trade-off between parameters, see how outliers effect the data etc.. \nSo really my questions is - whilst the grid search method I'm using is a bit cumbersome, what advantages would there be in using Monte Carlo methods such as metropolis hastings instead?\nI am currently researching into MCMC methods, but don’t have any practical experience in using them and, in this instance, can’t quite see what might be gained.\nI’d greatly appreciate any comments or suggestions\nMany Thanks",

    "answer": "If you are implementing the DFFT entirely within Python, your code will run orders of magnitude slower than either package you mentioned. Not just because those libraries are written in much lower-level languages, but also (FFTW in particular) they are written so heavily optimized, taking advantage of cache locality, vector units, and basically every trick in the book, that it would not surprise me if they ran at 10,000x the speed of a naive Python implementation. Even if you are using numpy in your implementation, it will still pale in comparison.\nSo yes; use numpy's fftpack. If that is not fast enough, you can try the python bindings for FFTW (PyFFTW), but the speedup from fftpack to fftw will not be nearly as dramatic.  I really doubt there's a need to drop into C++ just for FFTs - they're sort of the ideal case for Python bindings.",

    "question": "I am learning about the Gradient Descent Algorithm and I implemented one such**(in python)** over the Boston Housing data set(in sklearn). I have implemented a cost function as well which takes in all the coefficients, the intercept and the training data and returns the cost for those coefficients and intercept. I ran the algorithm over the Boston data set for 1500 iterations and learning_rate = 0.000003202, and It converged successfully, giving the least cost as 61.840725406571245, but when I trained the sklearn's LinearRegression() algorithm over the same training data, and found the cost using .coef_ and .intercept_. It gave the least cost as 19.958219814238042. So My question is How can one say the a certain number of iterations, will give me the least/optimal cost? Like say I run the algorithm for n times, and obtain a particular cost, then How will I know that this cost is good enough or do I need to reduce it further?",
    "answer": "You can use validation sets in training. They will be a better indicator for the testing phase of your model performance than only the training error. Also, your learning_rate is quite small, which can cause the model to converge in large number of iterations. You can play with those parameters to see how it effects your training.",

After I change the instance class to t3, my code is back to 50 csv per min.\n\nAmazon RDS T3 DB instances run in Unlimited mode, which means that you will be charged if your average CPU utilization over a rolling 24-hour period exceeds the baseline of the instance.

The CPU Credit pricing is the same for all T3 instance sizes across all regions and is not covered by Reserved Instances.\n\nConsidering that my code takes <1 sec to execute, and only 1 record to insert each time. pandas.to_sql shouldn't be the bottleneck.

The only case in which this would get tricky is if a language only had constants (think val) and no variables (think var) - think purely functional languages.

Test data are [5,7], [3,8] and [3,8] respectively.\n\nAs you can notice, although the shuffle is different (technically it can be same), the training and testing data for the last two iteration are exactly same. As the number of iterations increase, your chance of fitting the same dataset increases which is counter-intuitive to the cross-validation idea where we would like get an estimate of generalizability of our model with limited amount of data.

The loss function acts as a guide to train the neural network to become better at a task.\nIf we sum the cross entropy loss outputs, we incur more loss in proportion to the batch size, since our loss grows linearly in proportion to the mini-batch size during training.\nWhereas, if we take the average, our loss is indifferent to the batch size since we are taking an average.\nFor your use case, I recommend taking the average, as that ensures that your loss function is decoupled from hyperparameters such as the aforementioned batch size.\nAnother intuitive example is that by averaging the loss, we normalize the loss output and that also helps stabilize training, since our network becomes less sensitive to learning rate. If in the case we use sum, we might get exploding gradient issues, which forces us to use a much lower learning rate, thus making our network more sensitive to hyperparameter values.",

    "question": "I'm trying to choose the best parameters for the hysteresis phase in the canny function of OpenCV. I found some similar questions in stackoverflow but they didn't solve my problem. So far I've found that there are two main approaches:\n\nCompute mean and standard deviation and set the thresholds as: lowT = mean - std, highT = mean+std\nCompute the median and set the thresholds as: 0.6*median, 1.33*median\n\nHowever, any of these thresholds is the best fit for my data. Manually, I've found that lowT=100, highT=150 are the best values. The data (gray-scale image) has the following properties:\nmedian=202.0, mean=206.6283375, standard deviation = 35.7482520742\nDoes anyvbody know where is the problem? or knows where can I found more information about this?",
    "answer": "Such image statistics as mean, std etc. are not sufficient to answer the question, and canny may not be the best approach; it all depends on characteristics of the image.

I have arrays of the central frequencies and of the lower and upper cutoffs.The final aim is to get a bar chart representing sound level versus the 1/3rd octave bands.\nFrom a theory that I followed suggested to first do FFT of the signal. Then reconstruct the signal in the 1/3rd octave bands. In each of the construction, compute the RMS values of the pressure. That's it. Convert these RMS values into sound level(dB) and plot against the central frequencies.\nThe issue I am facing is how to reconstruct the signal using IFFT function given that the new signal has less number of amplitude points. So, the reconstruction is essentially not possible because of dimension inconsistency between time and amplitude. I am stuck at this point.\nI have a very little experience in DSP. So, any help even if the approach is different from what I tried explaining above will be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.",
    "answer": "To reconstruct the time-domain signal for a particular 1/3 octave band, you set the amplitude to zero for all the frequencies outside of your band before you do the IFFT.  The IFFTs for each of those bands will be the same size as our original FFT, so you will end up with the same time resolution on output from each band.\nDoing a full-size IFFT for each band is obviously pretty expensive.  There are ways to optimize this, but really there is probably no reason for you to be reconstructing the time-domain signal in the first place.\nThe IFFT operation1 will not change the RMS value of signal, so just calculate this using the frequency-domain components and forget about the IFFT altogether.  Because of the way the RMS computation works, you don't even need to remember that the frequency-domain amplitudes are complex numbers -- you get a proportional answer if you treat the real and imaginary components the same way.  Just don't forget to include all the extra zeros in the RMS divisor, since there are a different number of them for each band.\n1 - This is true for a mathematically standard IFFT.  Some implementations will divide the outputs by the signal length.  This will be the same for all bands, so it won't affect their relative values and it's easy to correct for.",

    "question": "I am doing a project on multi-class text classification and could do with some advice.\nI have a dataset of reviews which are classified into 7 product categories.\nFirstly, I create a term document matrix using TF-IDF (tfidfvectorizer from sklearn). This generates a matrix of n x m where n in the number of reviews in my dataset and m is the number of features.\nThen after splitting term document matrix into 80:20 train:test, I pass it through the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm and achieve an accuracy of 53%.\nIn another experiment, I used the Google News Word2Vec pretrained embedding (300 dimensional) and averaged all the word vectors for each review. So, each review consists of x words and each of the words has a 300 dimensional vector. Each of the vectors are averaged to produce one 300 dimensional vector per review.\nThen I pass this matrix through KNN. I get an accuracy of 72%.\nAs for other classifiers that I tested on the same dataset, all of them performed better on the TF-IDF method of vectorization. However, KNN performed better on word2vec.\nCan anyone help me understand why there is a jump in accuracy for KNN in using the word2vec method as compared to when using the tfidf method?",
    "answer": "By using the external word-vectors, you've introduced extra info about the words to the word2vec-derived features – info that simply may not be deducible at all to the plain word-occurrece (TF-IDF) model.\nFor example, imagine just a single review in your train set, and another single review in your test set, use some less-common word for car like jalopy – but then zero other car-associated words.\nA TFIDF model will have a weight for that unique term in a particular slot - but may have no other hints in the training dataset that jalopy is related to cars at all. In TFIDF space, that weight will just make those 2 reviews more-distant from all other reviews (which have a 0.0 in that dimension). It doesn't help or hurt much. A review 'nice jalopy' will be no closer to 'nice car' than it is to 'nice movie'.\nOn the other hand, if the GoogleNews has a vector for that word, and that vector is fairly close to car, auto, wheels, etc, then reviews with all those words will be shifted a little in the same direction in the word2vec-space, giving an extra hint to some classifiers, especially, perhaps the KNN one. Now, 'nice jalopy' is quite a bit closer to 'nice car' than to 'nice movie' or most other 'nice [X]' reviews.\nUsing word-vectors from an outside source may not have great coverage of your dataset's domain words. (Words in GoogleNews, from a circa-2013 training run on news articles, might miss both words, and word-senses in your alternative & more-recent reviews.) And, summarizing a text by averaging all its words is a very crude method: it can learn nothing from word-ordering/grammar (that can often reverse intended sense), and aspects of words may all cancel-out/dilute each other in longer texts.\nBut still, it's bringing in more language info that otherwise wouldn't be in the data at all, so in some cases it may help.\nIf your dataset is sufficiently large, training your own word-vectors may help a bit, too. (Though, the gain you've seen so far suggests some useful patterns of word-similarities may not be well-taught from your limited dataset.)\nOf course also note that you can use blended techniques. Perhaps, each text can be even better-represented by a concatenation of the N TF-IDF dimensions and the M word2vec-average dimensions. (If your texts have many  significany 2-word phrases that mean hings different than the individual words, adding in word 2-grams features may help. If your texts have many typos or rare word variants that still share word-roots with other words, than adding in character-n-grams – word fragments – may help.)",

Thank you! \nAdded March 21: It looks like I didn't word my post appropriately. Sorry. What I'm trying to do is optimize the output of 10 different production units (given different speeds and amounts of downtime) for several scenarios. My goal is to place blocks of downtime to minimized the differences in production on a day-to-day basis. The amount of downtime and frequency each unit is allowed is given. I am currently trying to evaluate a three week cycle, meaning every three weeks each production unit is taken down for a given amount of hours. I was asking the computer to determine the order the units would be taken down based on the constraint that the lines come down only once every 3 weeks and the difference in daily production is the smallest possible. My first approach was to use Excel (as I tried to describe above) and it didn't work (no suprise there)... where 1- running, 0- off and when these are summed to calculate production. The calculated production is subtracted from a set max daily production. Then, these differences were compared going from Mon-Tues, Tues-Wed, etc for a three week time frame and minimized using solver. My next approach was to write a Matlab code where the input was a tolerance (set allowed variation day-to-day). Is there a program that already does this or an approach to do this easiest?

As one of your replies suggested, you are doing minimization. There are numerical techniques to do this such as simulated annealing, monte carlo sampling as well as traditional minimization algorithms. You might want to look into whether one is appropriate in your case.",

However I am not sure on how to do this in a proper way. \nI want to append the body of each ID in a different AND SPECIFIC table in batches, the ID will give me the information I need to save in the right table.

It only garantees that all data related to that id is in the partition and not splitted\nThe approach 2 forces me to output from the pandas_udf, a dataframe with the same schema of the input, which is not going to happen since I am transforming the eventhub message from CSV to dataframe in order to save it to the table. I could return the same dataframe that I received, but it sounds weird.\nIs there any nice approach I am not seeing?",
    "answer": "If your Id has distinct number of values (kind of type/country column) you can use partitionBy to store and thereby saving them to different table will be faster.\nOtherwise create a derive column(using withColumn) from you id column by using the logic same as you want to use while deviding data across tables.

Basically I have an agent foraging in a discrete environment, where the agent can see out some number of spaces around it (I'm assuming perfect knowledge of its observation space for simplicity, so the observation is the same as the state). The agent has an internal transition model of the world represented by an MLP (I'm using tf.keras). Basically, for each step in the tree, I use the model to predict the next state given the action, and I let the agent calculate how much reward it would receive based on the predicted change in state. From there it's the familiar MCTS algorithm, with selection, expansion, rollout, and backprop.\nEssentially, the problem is that this all runs prohibitively slowly. From profiling my code, I notice that a lot of time is spent doing the rollout, likely I imagine because the NN needs to be consulted many times and takes some nontrivial amount of time for each prediction. Of course, I can probably stand to clean up my code to make it run faster (e.g. better vectorization), but I was wondering:\n\nAre there ways to speed up/work around the traditional random walk done for rollout in MCTS?\nAre there generally other ways to speed up MCTS?

    "question": "Scikit-learn CountVectorizer for bag-of-words approach currently gives two sub-options: (a) use a custom vocabulary (b) if custom vocabulary is unavailable, then it makes a vocabulary based on all the words present in the corpus. \nMy question: Can we specify a custom vocabulary to begin with, but ensure that it gets updated when new words are seen while processing the corpus. I am assuming this is doable since the matrix is stored via a sparse representation. \nUsefulness: It will help in cases when one has to add additional documents to the training data, and one should not have to start from the beginning.",
    "answer": "No, this is not possible at present. It's also not \"doable\", and here's why.\nCountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer are designed to turn text documents into vectors. These vectors need to all have an equal number of elements, which in turn is equal to the size of the vocabulary, because that conventions is ingrained in all scikit-learn code. If the vocabulary is allowed to grow, then the vectors produced at various times have different lengths. This affects e.g. the number of parameters in a linear (or other parametric) classifiers trained on such vectors, which then also needs to be able to grow. It affects k-means and dimensionality reduction classes. It even affects something as simple as matrix multiplications, which can no longer be handled with a simple call to NumPy's dot routine, requiring custom code instead. In other words, allowing this flexibility in the vectorizers makes little sense unless you adapt all of scikit-learn to handle the result.\nWhile this would be possible, I (as a core scikit-learn developer) would strongly oppose the change because it makes the code very complicated, probably slower, and even if it would work, it would make it impossible to distinguish between a \"growing vocabulary\" and the much more common situation of a user passing data in the wrong way, so that the number of dimensions comes out wrong.\nIf you want to feed data in in batches, then either using a HashingVectorizer (no vocabulary) or do two passes over the data to collect the vocabulary up front.",

Moreover, Bootstrap works best for continuous data in a single column in case of 1D or 2d, as then you can produce a range of data for the whole column regardless of minority or majority class as if the measurements where taken n numbers of times (n is is any integer 1+)\nThus, in this question scenario, oversampling is preferred as it maintains the underlying structure of the data of the minority class.",

    "question": "I am working on an application using an IFM 3D camera to identify parts prior to a robot pickup. Currently I am able to find the centroid of these objects using contours from a depth image and from there calculate the center point of these objects in pixel space.\nMy next task is to then transform the 2D centroid coordinates to a 3D point in 'real' space. I am able to train the robot such that it's coordinate frame is either at the center of the image or at the traditional (0,0) point of an image (top left).\nThe 3D camera I am using provides both an intrinsic and extrinsic matrix. I know I need to use some combination of these matrices to project my centroid into three space but the following questions remain:\n\nMy current understanding from googling is the intrinsic matrix is used to fix lens distortion (barrel and pinhole warping, etc.) whereas the extrinsic matrix is used to project points into the real world. Is this simplified assumption correct?\n\nHow can a camera supply a single extrinsic matrix? I know traditionally these matrices are found using the checkerboard corners method but are these not dependent on the height of the camera?\n\nIs the solution as simple as taking the 3x4 extrinsic matrix and multiplying it by a 3x1 matrix [x, y, 1] and if so, will the returned values be relative to the camera center or the traditional (0,0) point of an image.\n\n\nThanks in advance for any insight! Also if it's any consolation I am doing everything in python and openCV.",
    "answer": "No. I suggest you read the basics in Multiple View Geometry of Hartley and Zisserman, freely available in the web. Dependent on the camera model, the intrinsics contain different parameters. For the pinhole camera model, these are the focal length and the principal point.\n\nThe only reason why you maybe could directly transform your 2D centroid to 3D is that you use a 3D camera. Read the manual of the camera, it should be explained how the relation between 2D and 3D coordinates is given for your specific model.\nIf you have only image data, you can only compute a 3D point from at least two views.\n\nNo, of course not. Please don't be lazy and start reading the basics about camera projection instead of asking for others to explain the common basics that are written down everywhere in the web and literature.",

    "question": "I have a set of co-ordinates(latitudes and longitudes) of different buildings of a city. The sample size is around 16,000. I plan to use these co-ordinates as the central point of their locality/neighbourhood, and do some analysis on the different neighbourhoods of the city. The \"radius/size\" for each neighbourhood is still undecided as of now.\nHowever, a lot of these co-ordinates are too close to each other. So, many of them actually represent the same locality/neighbourhood.\nAs a result, I want to select a smaller sample(say, 3-6k) of co-ordinates that will be more evenly spread out.\nExample:- If two of the co-ordinates are representing two neighbouring buildings, I don't want to include both as they pretty much represent the same area. So we must select only one of them.\nThis way, I was hoping to reduce the population to a smaller size, while at the same time being able to cover most of the city through the remaining co-ordinates.\nOne way I was imagining the solution is to plot these co-ordinates on a 2D graph(for visualisation). Then, we can select different values of \"radius\" to see how many co-ordinates would remain. But I do not know how to implement such a \"graph\".\nI am doing this analysis in Python. Is there a way I can obtain such a sample of these co-ordinates that are evenly distributed with minimal overlap?\nThanks for your help,",
    "answer": "It seems like for your use case, you might need clustering instead of sampling to reduce your analysis set.\nGiven that you'd want to reduce your \"houses\" data to \"neighborhoods\" data, I'd suggest exploring geospatial clustering to cluster houses that are closer together and then take your ~3-4K clusters as your data set to begin with.\nThat being said, if your objective still is to remove houses that are closer together, you can obviously create an N*N matrix of the geospatial distance between each house vs. others and remove pairs that are within (0, X] where X is your threshold.",

Also this has combinatorial complexity which is obviously undesirable.\nThanks.",
    "answer": "You want to generate a random n*m matrix of integers 1..k with every integer used, and no integer used twice in any row.  And you want to do it efficiently.\nIf you just want to generate a reasonable answer, reasonably quickly, you can generate the rows by taking a random selection of elements, and putting them into a random order.  numpy.random.random_sample and numpy.random.shuffle can do that.  You will avoid the duplicate element issue.  If you fail to use all of your elements, then what you can do is randomly \"evolve\" this towards a correct solution,  At every step identify all elements that are repeated more than once in the matrix, randomly select one, and convert it to an as yet unused integer from 1..k.  This will not cause duplications within rows, and will in at most k steps give you a matrix of the desired form.\nOdds are that this is a good enough answer for what you want, and is what you should do.  But it is imperfect - matrices of this form do not all happen with exactly equal probability.  (In particular ones with lots of elements only appearing once show up slightly more than they should.)  If you need a perfectly even distribution, then you're going to have to do a lot more work.\nTo get there you need a bit of theory.  If you have that theory, then you can understand the answer as, \"Do a dynamic programming solution forwards to find a count of all possible solutions, then run that backwards making random decisions to identify a random solution.\"  Odds are that you don't have that theory.\nI'm not going to give a detailed explanation of that theory.  I'll just outline what you do.\nYou start with the trivial statement, \"There are n!/(n-m)! ways in which I could have a matrix with 1 row satisfying my condition using m of the k integers, and none which use more.\"\nFor i from 1..n, for j from m to k, you figure out the count of ways in which you could build i rows using j of the k integers.  You ALSO keep track of how many of those ways came from which previous values for j for the previous row.  (You'll need that later.)  This step can be done in a double loop.\nNote that the value in the table you just generated for j=k and i=n is the number of matrices that satisfy all of your conditions.  We'll build a random one from the bottom up.\nFirst you generate a random row for the last row of your matrix - all are equally likely.\nFor each row until you get to the top, you use the table you built to randomly decide how many of the elements that you used in the last row you generated will never be used again.  Randomly decide which those elements will be.  Generate a random row from the integers that you are still using.\nWhen you get to the top you'll have chosen a random matrix meeting your description, with no biases in how it was generated.",

    "answer": "We don't have the whole model, so bring limited to work with partial information, here are some remarks:\n\nThe max Exp(sum()) objective can be replaced by max sum() (as exp() is monotonic). \nFor global optimization problems, I often use solvers like Baron, Couenne, and Antigone. The problem may be small enough to prove global optimality.\nYou can also try a multi-start approach: use multiple different starting points. This will at least prevent some really bad solutions. Some solvers have this built-in (e.g. Knitro) but it is not very difficult to implement this with a simple loop.\nSLSQP is a local solver. In theory, you could use basinhopping + SLSQP but I am not sure this works correctly with constraints.",

    "answer": "Here's the pipeline:\nInput image (could be in batches - let's say your network processes 10 images simultaneously) so 10 images of size (28, 28) -- 28 pixels height / weight and let's say the image has 1 filter only (grayscale).\nYou are supposed to provide to your network an input of size (10, 28, 28, 1), which will be accepted by a convolutional layer. You are free to use max pooling and maybe an activation function. Your convolutional layer will apply a number of filters of your choice -- let's assume you want to apply 40 filters. These are 40 different kernels applied with different weights. If you want to let's say classify these images you will (most likely) have a number of Dense layers after your convolutional layers. Before passing the output of the convolutional layers (which will be a representation of your input image after a feature extraction process) to your dense layers you have to flatten it in a way (You may use the simplest form of flattening, just passing the numbers one after the other). So your dense layer accepts the output of these 40 filters, which will be 'images' -- their size depends on many things (kernel size, stride, original image size) which will later be flattened into a vector, which supposedly propagates forward the information extracted by your conv layer.\nYour second question regarding MinMaxScaling (div by 255) - That is supposed to take place before everything else. There are other ways of normalizing your data (Standar scaling -- converting to 0 mean and unit variance) but keep in mind, when using transformations like that, you are supposed to fit the transformation on your train data and transform your test data accordingly. You are not supposed to fit and transform on your test data. Here, dividing by 255 everything is accepted but keep that in mind for the future.",

    "answer": "**Outlier Detection: A Comprehensive Overview**\n\n**Definition:**\nOutlier detection, also known as anomaly detection, aims to identify data points that exhibit distinct characteristics from the majority of the data. These unusual observations may indicate errors, fraud, or novel patterns that warrant further investigation.\n\n**Historical Developments:**\nThe concept of outlier detection dates back to the early 1900s, with statisticians developing methods to identify extreme values. Over the years, outlier detection techniques have evolved significantly, leveraging advancements in statistical modeling, machine learning, and data mining.\n\n**Statistical Approaches:**\nTraditional statistical approaches, such as Z-score and Grubbs' test, compare individual data points to the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. Points that deviate significantly (e.g., more than 3 standard deviations) are considered outliers.\n\n**Machine Learning and Data Mining Techniques:**\nWith the advent of Big Data, more sophisticated outlier detection methods have emerged. Supervised learning algorithms, such as Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF), learn patterns in the data to identify anomalies. Unsupervised learning methods, such as DBSCAN and k-means clustering, can also be adapted for outlier detection by isolating data points that do not fit into any cluster.\n\n**Future Trends:**\nWith the increasing volume and complexity of data, outlier detection is expected to gain further prominence. Advanced techniques such as deep learning and graph analytics are being explored to detect complex anomalies and patterns in unstructured data. Additionally, real-time outlier detection systems will become crucial for fraud detection, network intrusion prevention, and other applications requiring immediate identification of anomalies.\n\n**Interview Questions:**\n* Describe the statistical techniques used in outlier detection and their strengths and weaknesses.\n* Explain how machine learning algorithms can be applied for outlier detection and discuss their advantages over traditional methods.\n* Discuss the challenges and considerations in selecting an appropriate outlier detection technique for a specific dataset.\n\n**Regulatory and Legal Implications:**\nOutlier detection plays a role in various regulatory and legal contexts:\n* **Financial industry:** Identifying fraudulent transactions or suspicious investments.\n* **Healthcare:** Detecting abnormal patient data for early disease diagnosis.\n* **Security:** Monitoring network traffic for potential cyberattacks.\n* **Privacy:** Protecting sensitive information by identifying unusual access patterns.",

It's better to say LSTM specialized to learn sequential data.

The form of my particular problem is that of finding a0, a1, b0, and b1 such that the cost function:\n\\sum^N_{n=1} ( g_n - (y_n - b0 e^-(tn/b1)) / a0 e^-(tn/a1) )^2\nis minimized where g_n, y_n and t_n are known and there are interval constraints on a0, a1, b0, and b1.\nThe four unknown parameters span approximately four orders of magnitude (e.g, a0 = 2e-3, a1 = 30, similar for b0 and b1).  I have heard that a high dynamic range of unknown parameters can be numerically problematic for optimization routines.   \nMy first question is whether four or so orders of magnitude range would be problematic for scipy.optimize.minimize. The routine appears to converge on the data I've applied so far. \nMy second question relates to the form of the cost function.  I can equivalently write it as:\n\\sum^N_{n=1} ( g_n - ( 1/a0 e^(tn/a1) y_n - b0/a0 e^-(tn/b1) +tn/a1) / )^2\n=\n\\sum^N_{n=1} ( g_n - ( a0' e^(tn/a1) y_n - b0' e^-(tn*b1')) )^2\nwhere the new parameters are simple transformations of the original parameters.  Is there any advantage to doing this in terms of numerical stability or the avoidance of local minima?  I haven't proven it, but I wonder whether this new cost function would be convex as opposed to the original cost function.",
    "answer": "Most solvers are designed for variables in the 1-10 range. A large range can cause numerical problems, but it is not guaranteed to be problematic. Numerical problems sometimes stem from the matrix factorization step of the linear algebra for solving the Newton step, which is more dependent of the magnitude of the derivatives. You may also encounter challenges with termination tolerances for values outside the 1-10 range. Overall, if it looks like it's working, it's probably fine. You could get a slightly better answer by normalizing values.\nDivision by a degree of freedom can cause difficulties in three ways:\n\ndivision by zero\ndiscontinuous derivatives around 0\nvery steep derivatives near 0, or very flat derivatives far from 0\n\nFor these reasons, I would recommend \\sum^N_{n=1} ( g_n - ( a0' e^(tn/a1) y_n - b0' e^-(tn*b1')) )^2.

    "question": "Can you provide a summary about Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), considering their regulatory and legal implications, a step-by-step problem-solving guide, and their potential for cross-disciplinary applications?",
    "answer": "**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**\n\nGANs are a type of neural network that can generate new data from a given dataset. They are made up of two networks: a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator network creates new data from the dataset, while the discriminator network tries to distinguish between the real data and the generated data.\n\n**Regulatory and Legal Implications of GANs**\n\nGANs have a number of potential regulatory and legal implications, including:\n\n* **Copyright and intellectual property:** GANs can be used to create new works of art, music, and other creative content. This raises questions about who owns the copyright to these works and how they can be used.\n* **Privacy:** GANs can be used to create realistic images of people, which could be used for identity theft or other malicious purposes. This raises concerns about the privacy of individuals whose images are used to train GANs.\n* **Safety:** GANs can be used to create fake news articles, social media posts, and other content that could be harmful to society. This raises concerns about the safety of using GANs and the need for regulations to prevent their misuse.\n\n**Step-by-Step Problem-Solving Guide for GANs**\n\n1. **Choose a dataset.** The first step in training a GAN is to choose a dataset. The dataset should be representative of the data that you want to generate.\n2. **Build the generator and discriminator networks.** The next step is to build the generator and discriminator networks. The generator network should be designed to create new data from the dataset, while the discriminator network should be designed to distinguish between the real data and the generated data.\n3. **Train the GAN.** Once the generator and discriminator networks have been built, they need to be trained. The training process involves feeding the dataset into the generator network and the real data into the discriminator network. The generator network then tries to create new data that is indistinguishable from the real data, while the discriminator network tries to identify the generated data.\n4. **Evaluate the GAN.** After the GAN has been trained, it should be evaluated to see how well it can generate new data. The evaluation process involves feeding the generator network with new data and comparing the generated data to the real data.\n\n**Cross-disciplinary Applications and Synergies of GANs**\n\nGANs have a wide range of potential cross-disciplinary applications, including:\n\n* **Art and design:** GANs can be used to create new works of art and generate new designs for products and buildings.\n* **Healthcare:** GANs can be used to generate realistic medical images that can be used for diagnosis and treatment planning.\n* **Science:** GANs can be used to generate new data for scientific research and to accelerate the discovery of new drugs and treatments.\n\nGANs are a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize a number of industries and disciplines. However, it is important to be aware of the potential regulatory and legal implications of GANs and to use them responsibly.",

Simple question about sklearn's random forest: \nFor a true/false classification problem, is there a way in sklearn's random forest to specify the sample size used to train each tree, along with the ratio of true to false observations?\nMore details are below:\n\nIn the R implementation of random forest, called randomForest, there's an option sampsize(). This allows you to balance the sample used to train each tree based on the outcome. \nFor example, if you're trying to predict whether an outcome is true or false and 90% of the outcomes in the training set are false, you can set sampsize(500, 500). This means that each tree will be trained on a random sample (with replacement) from the training set with 500 true and 500 false observations. In these situations, I've found models perform much better predicting true outcomes when using a 50% cut-off, yielding much higher kappas. \nIt doesn't seem like there is an option for this in the sklearn implementation. \n\nIs there any way to mimic this functionality in sklearn? \nWould simply optimizing the cut-off based on the Kappa statistic achieve a similar result or is something lost in this approach?",

This parameter always splits the data in the same way.\nBut, if your data is ordered, e.g. by type, then the model will only be trained on a skewed subset. I.e. it will become specialised to data which is not fully representative of the population.\nThus, you could use the shuffle function to remove any orderings/biases in the subset before feeding it to the model.\nAnother similar purpose could be to prevent the model from learning the order of the data instead of inferring connections between data points.",

    "question": "Tried googling up, but could not find how to implement Sklearn metrics like cohen kappa, roc, f1score in keras as a metric for imbalanced data.\nHow to implement Sklearn Metric in Keras as Metric?",
    "answer": "Metrics in Keras and in Sklearn mean different things.  \nIn Keras metrics are almost same as loss. They get called during training at the end of each batch and each epoch for reporting and logging purposes. Example use is having the loss 'mse' but you still would like to see 'mae'. In this case you can add 'mae' as a metrics to the model.  \nIn Sklearn metric functions are applied on predictions as per the definition \"The metrics module implements functions assessing prediction error for specific purposes\". While there's an overlap, the statistical functions of Sklearn doesn't fit to the definition of metrics in Keras. Sklearn metrics can return float, array, 2D array with both dimensions greater than 1. There is no such object in Keras by the predict method.   \nAnswer to your question:\nIt depends where you want to trigger:\n\nEnd of each batch or each epoch\nYou can write a custom callback that is fired at the end of batch.  \nAfter prediction\nThis seems to be easier. Let Keras predict on the entire dataset, capture the result and then feed the y_true and y_pred arrays to the respective Sklearn metric.",

Does it mean, that essentially I can leverage this property to my benefit, for example by increasing the scale of certain predictor that I want KNN to give a priority to.\n\n\nThank you",
    "answer": "kNN would in the case of multiple predictors look at the Euclidian distance between vectors in the predictor space. E.g., if you have three predictors x1, x2, and x3, all data points will be a point in the 3-dimensional space. To measure the distance you simply compute $d=\\sqrt{(p_1-x_1)^2+(p_2-x_2)^2+(p_3-x_3)^2}$, and use that to find the neighbors.\n\nYou can definitely influence the distance measurements by scaling differently.

High bias leads to underfitting, while high variance leads to overfitting. Achieving an optimal tradeoff results in a model that generalizes well to new, unseen data by capturing underlying patterns without being overly influenced by noise.",

    "answer": "**Definition of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**\n\nKPIs are quantifiable measures used to track and assess the success of an organization, department, or individual towards achieving their strategic goals. They are designed to provide insights into various aspects of performance, including financial health, operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and innovation.\n\n**Role in Measuring Organizational Performance**\n\nKPIs play a vital role in measuring organizational performance by:\n\n* **Establishing Clear Goals:** KPIs define specific targets and objectives that the organization aims to achieve.\n* **Tracking Progress:** They allow organizations to monitor their progress towards those goals over time.\n* **Identifying Strengths and Weaknesses:** KPIs help pinpoint areas where the organization is excelling and areas that need improvement.\n* **Making Data-Driven Decisions:** By analyzing KPI data, organizations can make informed decisions based on objective evidence, rather than subjective assumptions.\n* **Improving Accountability:** KPIs foster accountability by holding individuals and teams responsible for achieving specific results.\n\nKPIs should be aligned with the organization's overall strategy and tailored to the specific context and industry. They should be relevant, measurable, attainable, and time-bound (SMART). By effectively using KPIs, organizations can gain valuable insights into their performance, identify areas for improvement, and ultimately enhance their success.",

I understand that they mutate the object, but if you call the sort method, after it's done then you'd call the reverse method so it should be fine. Why is it then that I need to type lst.sort() then on the line below, lst.reverse()?\nEdit: Well, when it's pointed out like that, it's a bit embarrassing how I didn't get it before. I literally recognize that it mutated the object and thus returns a None, but I suppose it didn't register that also meant that you can't reverse a None-type object.",

I read somewhere that cased models should only be used when there is a chance that letter casing will be helpful for the task. In my specific case: I am working with German texts. And in German all nouns start with the capital letter. So, I think, (correct me if I'm wrong) that this is the exact situation where cased model must be used. (There is also no uncased model available for German in spacy). \nBut what must be done with data in this situation?\nShould I (while preprocessing train data) leave it as it is (by that I mean not using the .lower() function) or it doesn't make any difference?",
    "answer": "The difference between \"BERT cased\" and \"BERT uncased\" can to finded in different contexts. For example, in the dialogs system, the users rarely put the text in their correct form, so,  is ordinary to find the words in lower case.

I am not tokenizing the sentences. I just split the each entry into list of words.\nAfter training word2vec model with 300 features, the shape of the model resulted in only 26000. How can I preserve all of my 45000 records ? \nIn the classifier model, I need all of those 45000 records, so that it can match 45000 output labels.",
    "answer": "If you are splitting each entry into a list of words, that's essentially 'tokenization'. \nWord2Vec just learns vectors for each word, not for each text example ('record') – so there's nothing to 'preserve', no vectors for the 45,000 records are ever created. But if there are 26,000 unique words among the records (after applying min_count), you will have 26,000 vectors at the end. \nGensim's Doc2Vec (the '\nParagraph Vector' algorithm) can create a vector for each text example, so you may want to try that. \nIf you only have word-vectors, one simplistic way to create a vector for a larger text is to just add all the individual word vectors together. Further options include choosing between using the unit-normed word-vectors or raw word-vectors of many magnitudes; whether to then unit-norm the sum; and whether to otherwise weight the words by any other importance factor (such as TF/IDF). \nNote that unless your documents are very long, this is a quite small training set for either Word2Vec or Doc2Vec.",

    "answer": "Several scikit-learn tools such as GridSearchCV and cross_val_score rely internally on Python’s multiprocessing module to parallelize execution onto several Python processes by passing n_jobs > 1 as argument.\nTaken from Sklearn documentation: \n\nThe problem is that Python multiprocessing does a fork system call\n  without following it with an exec system call for performance reasons.\n  Many libraries like (some versions of) Accelerate / vecLib under OSX,\n  (some versions of) MKL, the OpenMP runtime of GCC, nvidia’s Cuda (and\n  probably many others), manage their own internal thread pool. Upon a\n  call to fork, the thread pool state in the child process is corrupted:\n  the thread pool believes it has many threads while only the main\n  thread state has been forked. It is possible to change the libraries\n  to make them detect when a fork happens and reinitialize the thread\n  pool in that case: we did that for OpenBLAS (merged upstream in master\n  since 0.2.10) and we contributed a patch to GCC’s OpenMP runtime (not\n  yet reviewed).",

    "question": "Define batch normalization for me and talk about concepts associated with it",
    "answer": "Alright! Here goes the definition: Batch normalization is a technique applied during the training of neural networks that normalizes the inputs to a neural network layer. It helps to stabilize the training process and accelerate convergence by reducing the internal covariate shift. Internal covariate shift refers to the changes in the distribution of activations within a layer as the network learns.\n\nNow, let me explain this further. In a neural network, each layer takes an input and produces an output. The distribution of the input to a layer can change as the network learns. This can make it difficult for the network to learn, as the weights and biases of the layer must constantly be adjusted to accommodate the changing input distribution.\n\nBatch normalization solves this problem by normalizing the input to each layer. This means that the mean and standard deviation of the input to each layer are fixed, regardless of the batch of data that is being processed. This helps to stabilize the training process and accelerate convergence.\n\nIn addition to reducing internal covariate shift, batch normalization also has a number of other benefits. These include:\n\n- Improved generalization: Batch normalization can help to improve the generalization of a neural network by reducing overfitting.\n- Faster training: Batch normalization can help to speed up the training of a neural network by reducing the number of iterations required to reach convergence.\n- Reduced sensitivity to hyperparameters: Batch normalization can help to reduce the sensitivity of a neural network to the choice of hyperparameters such as learning rate and weight decay.\n\nBatch normalization is a powerful technique that can be used to improve the training of neural networks. It is a relatively simple technique to implement and can be used with any type of neural network.",

    "answer": "Since it is a measurement problem, maybe what you want to look at is how similarly the instruments mismeasure the ground truth or actual phenomenon. That is, look at the correlation of the measurement error (defined as the measurement minus the ground truth) between pairs of instruments. \nIf you create a matrix X which has 1 column for each instrument and 1 row for each set of measurement errors at a given time, then the correlation is just transpose(X) times X. If you don't have ground truth, maybe the mean of the measurements is a workable substitute. If you aren't measuring the instruments all at the same time, calculating the correlation between errors will be more involved.\nSince this is mostly a discussion question, it's really more suitable for stats.stackexchange.com. Good luck and have fun, it's an interesting problem.",

Each number n in the list can be expressed as n = (x*d) + y, where y = n % d.\nFor any 3 integers x, y, z, (x + y + z) will be divisible by d if and only if (x%d + y%d + z%d) % d = 0.\nYou can bucket all numbers in the list based their remainder (ie. n%d)\nYou will have d buckets (ranging from 0 to d-1).\nGenerate all possible triplets using integers in range [0, d-1] that add up to 0, d or 2*d. This will give you the bucket combinations that can be used to obtain a valid triplet.\nSince you know the number of elements in each bucket, you can calculate the number of valid triplets. (for example, if bucket 0 has 10 elements, the triplet (0,0,0) will have 10*9*8 corresponding triplets).\n\nThis algorithm should be enough to set you on track to complete the problem.

    "question": "I am in 10th grade and I am looking to use a machine learning model on patient data to find a correlation between the time of week and patient adherence. I have separated the week into 21 time slots, three for each time of day (1 is Monday morning, 2 is monday afternoon, etc.). Adherence values will be binary (0 means they did not take the medicine, 1 means they did). I will simulate training, validation and test data for my model. From my understanding, I can use a logistic regression model to output the probability of the patient missing their medication on a certain time slot given past data for that time slot. This is because logistic regression outputs binary values when given a threshold and is good for problems dealing with probability and binary classes, which is my scenario. In my case, the two classes I am dealing with are yes they will take their medicine, and no they will not. But the major problem with this is that this data will be non-linear, at least to my understanding. To make this more clear, let me give a real life example. If a patient has yoga class on Sunday mornings, (time slot 19) and tends to forget to take their medication at this time, then most of the numbers under time slot 19 would be 0s, while all the other time slots would have many more 1s. The goal is to create a machine learning model which can realize given past data that the patient is very likely going to miss their medication on the next time slot 19. I believe that logistic regression must be used on data that still has an inherently linear data distribution, however I am not sure. I also understand that neural networks are ideal for non-linear distributions, but neural networks require a lot of data to function properly, and ideally the goal of my model is to be able to function decently with simply a few weeks of data. Of course any model becomes more accurate with more data, but it seems to me that generally neural networks need thousands of data sets to truly become decently accurate. Again, I could very well be wrong.\nMy question is really what model type would work here. I do know that I will need some form of supervised classification. But can I use logistic regression to make predictions when given time of week about adherence?\nReally any general feedback on my project is greatly appreciated! Please keep in mind I am only 15, and so certain statements I made were possibly wrong and I will not be able to fully understand very complex replies.\nI also have to complete this within the next two weeks, so please do not hesitate to respond as soon as you can!

For instance for the following array:\na = [3, 12, 5, 2, 3, 7, 4, 3]\nwith k = 3 and p = 12, the ordered list of all k-sized contiguous subarray products will be:\nk_products = [180, 120, 30, 42, 84, 84]\nand modulo p we have:\nk_products_p = [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]\nwe can easily compute k_products using a sliding window. All we have to do is to compute the product for the first k-sized subarray and then compute the next elements of k_product using the following formula:\nk_product[i] = k_product[i - 1] * a[i + k] / a[i - 1]\nand after forming the whole list, we can compute k_product[i] % p for each i to get k_product_p. That's it. O(n) complexity is pretty good.\nBut if the elements of a[i] are big, the elements of k_product may overflow, and thus we cannot compute k_product_p. Plus, we cannot, for example do the following:\nk_product[i] = ((k_product[i - 1] % p) * (a[i + k] % p) / (a[i - 1] % p)) % p  // incorrect\nSo is there a fast algorithm to do this? Note that p is not necessarily prime and it is also not necessarily coprime to the elements of a.\nEdit: As mentioned in the comments, there will be no overflow in python, but working with very big numbers will be time-consuming.",
    "answer": "This is not a sliding window algorithm, but it is a simple and effective way to solve this problem in O(n) time without any division:\nLet A be your original array.  We will imagine that there is a \"mark\" on every kth element of A -- elements A[0], A[k], A[2k], etc.  This ensures that every k-length window in A will contain exactly one mark.\nNow, make two new arrays B and C, such that:\n\nIn array B, each element B[i] will contain the product (mod p) of A[i] and all following elements up to but not including the next mark.  If A[i] is marked, then B[i] = 1.  You can calculate this in a single pass backward from i=n-1 to i=0.\n\nIn array C, each element C[i] will contain the product (mod p) of A[i] and all preceding elements down to and including the previous mark.  If A[i] is marked, then C[i] = A[i].  You can calculate this in a single pass forward from i=0 to i=n-1.\n\n\nNow, you can easily calculate the complete product of any k-length window in constant time, because the product of any window from A[i]...A[i+k-1] is just B[i] * C[i+k-1].  Remember that there is exactly one mark inside the window.  B[i] is the product of the elements before the mark, and C[i+k-1] is the product of the marked element and the elements after it.",

    "answer": "[Please credit Pete Kirkham, he first came with the reference to SUMO which may well answer the question asked by Alex, the OP]\n(I'm just providing a complement of information here; I started in a comment field but soon ran out of space and layout capabilites...)\nAlex: Most of SUMO is science or engineering? It does not contain every-day words like foods, people, cars, jobs, etc?\nPete K: SUMO is an upper ontology. The mid-level ontologies (where you would find concepts between 'thing' and 'beef burrito') listed on the page don't include food, but reflect the sorts of organisations which fund the project. There is a mid-level ontology for people. There's also one for industries (and hence jobs), including food suppliers, but no mention of burritos if you grep it.\nMy two cents\n100% of WordNet (3.0 i.e. the latest, as well as older versions) is mapped to SUMO, and that may just be what Alex need. The mid-level ontologies associated with SUMO (or rather with MILO) are effectively in specific domains, and do not, at this time, include Foodstuff, but since WordNet does (include all -well, many of- these everyday things) you do not need to leverage any formal ontology \"under\" SUMO, but instead use Sumo's WordNet mapping (possibly in addition to WordNet, which, again, is not an ontology but with its informal and loose \"hierarchy\" may also help.\nSome difficulty may arise, however, from two area (and then some ;-) ?):\n\nthe SUMO ontology's \"level\" may not be the level you'd have in mind for your particular application.  For example while \"Burrito\" brings \"Food\", at top level entity in SUMO  \"Chicken\" brings well \"Chicken\" which only through a long chain finds \"Animal\"  (specifically: Chicken->Poultry->Bird->Warm_Blooded_Vertebrae->Vertebrae->Animal).\nWordnet's coverage and metadata is impressive, but with regards to the mid-level concepts can be a bit inconsistent.  For example \"our\" Burrito's hypernym is appropriately \"Dish\", which provides it with circa 140 food dishes, which includes generics such as \"Soup\" or \"Casserole\" as well as \"Chicken Marengo\" (but omitting say \"Chicken Cacciatore\")\n\nMy point, in bringing up these issues, is not to criticize WordNet or SUMO and its related ontologies, but rather to illustrate simply some of the challenges associated with building ontology, particularly at the mid-level.\nRegardless of some possible flaws and lackings of a solution based on SUMO and WordNet, a pragmatic use of these frameworks may well \"fit the bill\" (85% of the time)",

    "answer": "I wouldn't be so quick to write off Naive Bayes. It does fine in many domains where there are lots of weak clues (as in \"overlapping words\"), but no absolutes. It all depends on the features you pass it. I'm guessing you are blindly passing it the usual \"bag of words\" features, perhaps after filtering for stopwords. Well, if that's not working, try a little harder. \nA good approach is to read a couple of hundred tweets and see how you know which category you are looking at. That'll tell you what kind of things you need to distill into features. But be sure to look at lots of data, and focus on the general patterns.\nAn example (but note that I haven't looked at your corpus): Time expressions may be good clues on whether you are pre- or post-sale, but they take some work to detect. Create some features \"past expression\", \"future expression\", etc. (in addition to bag-of-words features), and see if that helps. Of course you'll need to figure out how to detect them first, but you don't have to be perfect: You're after anything that can help the classifier make a better guess. \"Past tense\" would probably be a good feature to try, too.",

    "answer": "**Overview of Actor-Critic Methods**\n\nActor-critic methods are a class of reinforcement learning algorithms that combine two neural networks: an 'actor' that selects actions, and a 'critic' that evaluates the actor's performance. This architecture allows the critic to provide feedback to the actor, enabling it to improve its decision-making over time. Actor-critic methods are particularly well-suited for solving continuous control tasks, where the action space is large and complex.\n\n**Impact on Society**\n\nActor-critic methods have had a significant impact on society by enabling the development of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) applications:\n\n- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Actor-critic methods are used to train self-driving cars to navigate complex environments, make decisions, and avoid obstacles.\n- **Robotics:** Actor-critic methods allow robots to learn complex motor skills, such as grasping objects, walking, and manipulating tools.\n- **Natural Language Processing:** Actor-critic methods are used to develop AI systems that can engage in natural language conversations, generate text, and translate languages.\n\n**Impact on Industry**\n\nActor-critic methods are increasingly adopted by industries due to their effectiveness in solving challenging reinforcement learning problems:\n\n- **Healthcare:** Actor-critic methods aid in developing AI systems for early disease diagnosis, treatment optimization, and personalized medicine.\n- **Finance:** Actor-critic methods assist in developing trading algorithms, portfolio optimization strategies, and risk management systems.\n- **Manufacturing:** Actor-critic methods allow for optimizing production processes, improving resource allocation, and reducing costs.\n\n**Interview Questions**\n\nHere are some potential interview questions related to actor-critic methods:\n\n- Describe the key components and architecture of actor-critic methods.\n- Explain how actor-critic methods are used to solve continuous control tasks.\n- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of actor-critic methods compared to other reinforcement learning algorithms.\n- Provide an example of a real-world application where actor-critic methods have been successfully utilized.\n\n**Practical Examples**\n\nHere are a few practical examples of how actor-critic methods are being used today:\n\n- **OpenAI Five:** OpenAI Five is a team of AI agents that uses actor-critic methods to play the game of Dota 2 at a professional level.\n- **DeepMind's AlphaGo:** DeepMind's AlphaGo is a computer program that uses actor-critic methods to play the game of Go, and has defeated some of the world's top human players.\n- **Uber's Autonomous Vehicles:** Uber's self-driving vehicles use actor-critic methods to navigate roads and make decisions in real-time.",

Thus, I would suggest fine-tuning it on a dataset like a tweeter or other social media hashtags; however, if you are only focusing on hashtags and do not care about the text, that might work! My little experience with fine-tuning transformers like BART and BERT shows that the dataset that you are working on should be very similar to your actual data. But in general, you can fine-tune a model with different datasets, and if the datasets are structured for one goal, it can improve the model's accuracy.",

    "question": "I have a list of tuples with the start and end node ID of a segment. I want to rearrange the tuples (segments) in a way that constructs a continuous path. There can be a loop in the path i.e., one node can be traversed multiple times. I do know the origin and destination of the entire path. There may be some segments that cannot be included in the path as their start or end node cannot be connected to the previous or next node to form that continuous path. These segments should be removed from the rearranged list of tuples.\nExample:\nThe list of tuples may look like the following. Also, I know that the path should start at 101 and end at 205.\n[(101, 203), (104, 202), (203, 104), (104, 208), (185, 205), (202, 185)]\nExpected Results:\n[(101, 203), (203, 104), (104, 202), (202, 185), (185, 205)]\nI would like to solve this in Python. My understanding is that this can be solved using a loop that looks at the end node ID of each segment, finds a segment with a similar start node ID, and adds that append that segment to the list of rearranged tuples. I am not quite sure how it can be solved efficiently. So, any hints or example codes would really help.",
    "answer": "The main challenge in this question is probably just choosing between tuples with the same starting/ending node, e.g. choosing between whether (104, 202) or (104, 208) should come after (203, 104). You didn't really make it clear of what conditions the resultant path must satisfy so I assume any continuous path is fine.\nIn such a case, this question can simply be framed as a shortest path question, so you just need to find the shortest path between node 101 and 205, and the weight of each vertice is just 1 if the node tuple exist in the set, else infinity. So for example. the vertice between 203 and 104 is 1 since (203, 104) is in the original list, on the other hand the weight between 203 and 208 is infinity, since the vertice doesn't exist. You can then apply the standard Dijkstra shortest path algorithm to obtain the nodes traversed and therefore the tuples.\nEdit\n\nI think I misunderstood what you are trying to do, so I think you are actually trying to include as many nodes as possible for the path created. In such a case, perhaps something like breadth first search would be possible, where you keep track of all possible paths and keep deleting those that have no further possible connections.",

Use this as the first scaler choice to transform a feature, as it will preserve the shape of the dataset (no distortion).\nStandardScaler() will transform each value in the column to range about the mean 0 and standard deviation 1, ie, each value will be normalised by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation. Use StandardScaler if you know the data distribution is normal.\nIf there are outliers, use RobustScaler(). Alternatively you could remove the outliers and use either of the above 2 scalers (choice depends on whether data is normally distributed)\nAdditional Note: If scaler is used before train_test_split, data leakage will happen.

Every time a distance between two cities is required, it is just retrieved from the matrix using the id of the two cities as the index.\nBut even with this, it takes just as much time.

And if the vocabulary & word-balance in the new texts mainly train some words, not all, those recently-updated words can be pulled arbitrarily out of strong-comparability-alignment with earlier words that didn't get more training.

Could someone please advice?",
    "answer": "I'm not sure exactly what you mean by the term \"dataset\", but I will assume you are asking about co-registering multiple images from different patients (i.e. multiple 3D images per subject).\nTo answer your questions:\n\nIf there are no obvious choices about which image is best, then a random choice is fine. If you have e.g. a CT and an MRI for each subject, then co-registration using the CT images is likely going to give you better results because of intrinsic image characteristics (e.g. less distortion, image value linked to physical quantity).\nI suppose that depends on what you want to do, but if it is important to have all imaging data in the same co-registered reference space then yes.\n\nAnother option is to try and generate an average image, and then use that as a reference to register other images to. Without more information about what you are trying to achieve it's hard to give any more specific advice.",

    "question": "I'm a student in medical imaging. I have to construct a neural network for image segmentation. I have a data set of 285 subjects, each with 4 modalities (T1, T2, T1ce, FLAIR) + their respective segmentation ground truth. Everything is in 3D with resolution of 240x240x155 voxels (this is BraTS data set).\nAs we know, I cannot input the whole image on a GPU for memory reasons. I have to preprocess the images and decompose them in 3D overlapping patches (sub-volumes of 40x40x40) which I do with scikit-image view_as_windows and then serialize the windows in a TFRecords file. Since each patch overlaps of 10 voxels in each direction, these sums to 5,292 patches per volume. The problem is, with only 1 modality, I get sizes of 800 GB per TFRecords file. Plus, I have to compute their respective segmentation weight map and store it as patches too. Segmentation is also stored as patches in the same file. \nAnd I eventually have to include all the other modalities, which would take nothing less than terabytes of storage. I also have to remember I must also sample equivalent number of patches between background and foreground (class balancing).\nSo, I guess I have to do all preprocessing steps on-the-fly, just before every training step (while hoping not to slow down training too). I cannot use tf.data.Dataset.from_tensors() since I cannot load everything in RAM. I cannot use tf.data.Dataset.from_tfrecords() since preprocessing the whole thing before takes a lot of storage and I will eventually run out.\nThe question is : what's left for me for doing this cleanly with the possibility to reload the model after training for image inference ?\nThank you very much and feel free to ask for any other details.\nPierre-Luc",
    "answer": "Finally, I found a method to solve my problem.\nI first crop a subject's image without applying the actual crop. I only measure the slices I need to crop the volume to only the brain. I then serialize all the data set images into one TFRecord file, each training example being an image modality, original image's shape and the slices (saved as Int64 feature). \nI decode the TFRecords afterward. Each training sample are reshaped to the shape it contains in a feature. I stack all the image modalities into a stack using tf.stack() method. I crop the stack using the previously extracted slices (the crop then applies to all images in the stack). I finally get some random patches using tf.random_crop() method that allows me to randomly crop a 4-D array  (heigh, width, depth, channel).\nThe only thing I still haven't figured out is data augmentation. Since all this is occurring in Tensors format, I cannot use plain Python and NumPy to rotate, shear, flip a 4-D array. I would need to do it in the tf.Session(), but I would rather like to avoid this and directly input the training handle.\nFor the evaluation, I serialize in a TFRecords file only one test subject per file. The test subject contains all modalities too, but since there is no TensorFLow methods to extract patches in 4-D, the image is preprocessed in small patches using Scikit-Learn extract_patches() method. I serialize these patches to the TFRecords.\nThis way, training TFRecords is a lot smaller. I can evaluate the test data using batch prediction.\nThanks for reading and feel free to comment !",

    "answer": "I'm writing this partially in response to the other answer here.\nLogistic regression and naive Bayes are both linear models that produce linear decision boundaries.\nLogistic regression is the discriminative counterpart to naive Bayes (a generative model). You decode each model to find the best label according to p(label | data). What sets Naive Bayes apart is that it does this via Bayes' rule: p(label | data) ∝ p(data | label) * p(label).\n(The other answer is right to say that the Naive Bayes features are independent of each other (given the class), by the Naive Bayes assumption. With collinear features, this can sometimes lead to bad probability estimates for Naive Bayes—though the classification is still quite good.)\nThe factoring here is how Naive Bayes handles class imbalance so well: it's keeping separate books for each class. There's a parameter for each (feature, label) pair. This means that the super-common class can't mess up the super-rare class, and vice versa.\nThere is one place that the imbalance might seep in: the p(labels) distribution. It's going to match the empirical distribution in your training set: if it's 90% label A, then p(A) will be 0.9.\nIf you think that the training distribution of labels isn't representative of the testing distribution, you can manually alter the p(labels) values to match your prior belief about how frequent label A or label B, etc., will be in the wild.",

    "answer": "The read and write times for SSDs are significantly higher than standard 7200 RPM disks (it's still worth it with a 10k RPM disk, not sure how much of an improvement it is over a 15k). So, yes, you'd get much faster times on data access.\nThe performance improvement is undeniable. Then, it's a question of economics. 2TB 7200 RPM disks are $170 a piece, and 100GB SSDS cost $210. So if you have a lot of data, you may run into a problem.\nIf you read/write a lot of data, get an SSD. If the application is CPU intensive, however, you'd benefit much more from getting a better processor.",

Then, test in turn for serial correlation (if the data is a time series) and heteroscedasticity.\nThe approach you are describing of \"garbage in, garbage out\" risks overfitting - since you don't seem to be screening the inputs themselves for their relevance in predicting the output.",

    "question": "I am confused now about the loss functions used in XGBoost. Here is how I feel confused:\n\nwe have objective, which is the loss function needs to be minimized; eval_metric: the metric used to represent the learning result. These two are totally unrelated (if we don't consider such as for classification only logloss and mlogloss can be used as eval_metric). Is this correct? If I am, then for a classification problem, how you can use rmse as a performance metric?\ntake two options for objective as an example, reg:logistic and binary:logistic. For 0/1 classifications, usually binary logistic loss, or cross entropy should be considered as the loss function, right? So which of the two options is for this loss function, and what's the value of the other one? Say, if binary:logistic represents the cross entropy loss function, then what does reg:logistic do?\nwhat's the difference between multi:softmax and multi:softprob? Do they use the same loss function and just differ in the output format? If so, that should be the same for reg:logistic and binary:logistic as well, right?\n\nsupplement for the 2nd problem\nsay, the loss function for 0/1 classification problem should be\nL = sum(y_i*log(P_i)+(1-y_i)*log(P_i)). So if I need to choose binary:logistic here, or reg:logistic to let xgboost classifier to use L loss function. If it is binary:logistic, then what loss function reg:logistic uses?",
    "answer": "'binary:logistic' uses -(y*log(y_pred) + (1-y)*(log(1-y_pred)))\n'reg:logistic' uses (y - y_pred)^2\nTo get a total estimation of error we sum all errors and divide by number of samples.\n\nYou can find this in the basics. When looking on Linear regression VS Logistic regression.\nLinear regression uses (y - y_pred)^2 as the Cost Function\nLogistic regression uses -(y*log(y_pred) + (y-1)*(log(1-y_pred))) as the Cost function\n\nEvaluation metrics are completely different thing. They design to evaluate your model. You can be confused by them because it is logical to use some evaluation metrics that are the same as the loss function, like MSE in regression problems. However, in binary problems it is not always wise to look at the logloss. My experience have thought me (in classification problems) to generally look on AUC ROC.\nEDIT\n\naccording to xgboost documentation:\n\nreg:linear: linear regression\n\n\nreg:logistic: logistic regression\n\n\nbinary:logistic: logistic regression for binary classification, output\nprobability\n\nSo I'm guessing:\nreg:linear: is as we said, (y - y_pred)^2\nreg:logistic is -(y*log(y_pred) + (y-1)*(log(1-y_pred))) and rounding predictions with 0.5 threshhold\nbinary:logistic is plain -(y*log(y_pred) + (1-y)*(log(1-y_pred))) (returns the probability)\nYou can test it out and see if it do as I've edited.

About 26k of these entries are put into a single list (let's call it data).

    "question": "Suppose I have trained the doc2vec model with 50000 documents and I want to infer vectors for a separate dataset containing 36000 documents. In this case will the inferred vectors be effective for the downstream task of classification, becasue my assumption is that the inferred vectors depend on the size of documents with which the model is trained. \nNote: Both dataset i.e one used for training doc2vec and other for inferring vectors are unique but from the same domain of US supreme court.\nPlease correct me if I am wrong with valid reason.",
    "answer": "With such a tiny dataset, no answer I can give will be as useful as just trying it to see if it works. \n50000 is smallish for a training set, but some useful Doc2Vec results have been based on similar corpuses. \nVector inference, like training, reduces documents of any length to a fixed-size vector. (But note: gensim silently limits any text fed to a 2Vec model to 10000 tokens.) \nBut, if you've trained a model on documents that are all about 1000 words, then try inference on 10-word fragments, those doc-vectors might not be as useful, or useful in the same way, as inferred vectors on documents more similar to the training set. But you'd still need to try it to find out. (Also note: words not learned during training are completely ignored during inference, so later inferences on docs with many/all unknown words will be weak or meaningless.)\nIs that the the case with your inference docs – they are very different from training docs in size & vocabulary? And if so, why? (Can you train with more representative documents?)\nIf the set of 36000 documents is fixed before training begins, it may also be valid/defensible to include them in the unsupervised Doc2Vec training.

    "answer": "Sudden drops in validation loss and training loss occur due to the batch training; in essence, the convergence would be smooth only if we trained with the entire dataset, not with batches. Therefore, it is normal to see such drops (both for training and for validation).\n\nval_loss: 1.4935 - val_accuracy: 0.8737 (Previous epoch)\nval_loss: 1.7569 - val_accuracy: 0.6055 (Epoch with drop)\nval_loss: 1.4756 - val_accuracy: 0.9023 (Next epoch)\n\nIf you take a look at the validation loss, it merely increased with 0.26; however, this resulted in a 27% decrease in your accuracy. In this case, it is due to the fact that your model is not certain when it makes a prediction (at least at this stage of training).\nImagine that you have a binary classification model(between apples and oranges). At each prediction, when the ground truth is an apple, the network is 51% confident that the image is of an apple. We have the ground_truth apple, and as Keras does behind the curtains, the default confidence threshold is 50%. Then all the predictions are good and you have a good accuracy.\nHowever, now comes the 'problematic' epoch. Due to the changed values of the weights of your neural network after another epoch of training, when you predict on your validation dataset, you get a confidence of 48-49% for each ground_truth apple, and again, since the threshold is 50%, you get much poorer accuracy than the previous epoch.\nThis particular case that you are experiencing, as you can now infer from the previous explanation, does not affect the loss so much, but the accuracy. It does not affect the loss that much during backpropagation, because a difference in the confidence prediction between 49% and 51% when computing the loss is not a very significant difference in the overall loss(as you see in your case, only a 0.26%). In the end, even at the 'previous epoch', when the model predicted correctly an apple, the neural network was not that extremely confident, by yielding only 51% confidence for an apple, not 95% for instance.",

All users should use the numerically more robust scipy.linalg.expm function instead.\n\nAlthough expm2 and expm3 are deprecated since release version SciPy 0.13.0, I have found that in many situations these implementations are faster than expm.\nFrom this, some questions arise: \nIn what situations could expm2 and expm3 result in numerical instabilities? \nIn what situations (e.g. sparse matrices, symmetric, ...) is each of the algorithms faster/more precise?",
    "answer": "This will depend a lot on the detail of the implementation of these different ways of exponentiating the matrix.\nIn general terms, I would expect the eigen-decomposition (expm2) to be poorly suited to sparse matrices, because it is likely to remove the sparseness. It will also be more difficult to apply to non-symmetric matrices, because this will require the use of complex arithmetic and more expensive algorithms to compute the eigen-decomposition.\nFor the Taylor-series approach (expm3), this sounds risky if there are a fixed number of terms independent of the norm of the matrix. When computing e^x for a scalar x, the largest terms in the Taylor series are around that for which n is close to x.\nHowever, the implementation details of these (deprecated) functions may use tricks like diagonally loading the matrix so as to improve the stability of these series expansion.",

More over for predictions you don't need logits because argmax(linear(x)) == argmax(softmax(linear(x)) i.e softmax does not change the ordering but only change the magnitudes (squashing function which converts arbitrary value into [0,1] range, but preserves the partial ordering]\nIf you want to use activation functions to add some sort of non-linearity you normally do that by using a multi-layer NN and having the activation functions in the last but other layers.\nFinally, if you are using other loss function like NLLLoss, PoissonNLLLoss, BCELoss then you have to calculates sigmoid yourself.

    "question": "I have a scientific application that reads a potentially huge data file from disk and transforms it into various Python data structures such as a map of maps, list of lists etc. NumPy is called in for numerical analysis. The problem is, the memory usage can grow rapidly. As swap space is called in, the system slows down significantly. The general strategy I have seen:\n\nlazy initialization: this doesn't seem to help in the sense that many operations require in memory data anyway. \nshelving: this Python standard library seems support writing data object into a datafile (backed by some db) . My understanding is that it dumps data to a file, but if you need it, you still have to load all of them into memory, so it doesn't exactly help. Please correct me if this is a misunderstanding.\nThe third option is to leverage a database, and offload as much data processing to it\n\nAs an example: a scientific experiment runs several days and have generated a huge (tera bytes of data) sequence of:\n\nco-ordinate(x,y) observed event E at time t.\n\nAnd we need to compute a histogram over t for each (x,y) and output a 3-dimensional array.\nAny other suggestions? I guess my ideal case would be the in-memory data structure can be phased to disk based on a soft memory limit and this process should be as transparent as possible. Can any of these caching frameworks help? \nEdit:\nI appreciate all the suggested points and directions. Among those, I found user488551's comments to be most relevant. As much as I like Map/Reduce, to many scientific apps, the setup and effort for parallelization of code is even a bigger problem to tackle than my original question, IMHO. It is difficult to pick an answer as my question itself is so open ... but Bill's answer is more close to what we can do in real world, hence the choice. Thank you all.",
    "answer": "Well, if you need the whole dataset in RAM, there's not much to do but get more RAM. Sounds like you aren't sure if you really need to, but keeping all the data resident requires the smallest amount of thinking :) \nIf your data comes in a stream over a long period of time, and all you are doing is creating a histogram, you don't need to keep it all resident.  Just create your histogram as you go along, write the raw data out to a file if you want to have it available later, and let Python garbage collect the data as soon as you have bumped your histogram counters.  All you have to keep resident is the histogram itself, which should be relatively small.",

Or this would result to a bad model ?\nThank you",
    "answer": "Did you try it, and get bad results?\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"deleted all stop points\". But, Gensim's Word2Vec is oblivious to what your tokens are, and doesn't really have any idea of 'sentences'.\nAll that matters is the lists-of-tokens you provide. (Sometimes people include puntuation like '.' as tokens, and sometimes it's stripped - and it doesn't make a very big different either way, and to the extent it does, whether it's good or bad may depend on your data & goals.)\nAny lists-of-tokens that include neighboring related tokens, for the sort of context-window training that's central to the word2vec algorithm, should work well.\nFor example, it can't learn anything from one-word texts, where there are no neighboring words. But running togther sentences, paragraphs, and even full documents into long texts works fine.\nEven concatenating wholly-unrelated texts doesn't hurt much: the bit of random noise from unrelated words now in-each-others' windows is outweighed, with enough training, by the meaningful relationships in the much-longer runs of truly-related text.\nThe main limit to consider is that each training text (list of tokens) shouldn't be more than 10,000 tokens long, as internal implementation limits up through Gensim 4.0 mean tokens past the 10,000th position will be ignored. (This limit might eventually be fixed - but until then, just splitting overlong texts into 10,000-token chunks is a fine workaround with negligible effects via the lost contexts at the break points.)",

    "question": "I hope this isn’t off topic, I am not really sure which forum to use for a question like this:\nI have a series of datapoints of about an hour in time from a sensor that retrieves data 20 times per second. Along with it I receive timestamps of a periodic event in this data in the format of %Y-%m-d %H:%M:%S.%f, which looks e.g. like this 2019-05-23 17:50:34.346000.\nI now created a method to calculate these periodic events myself and was wondering how I could evalute my methods accuracy. My calculations are sometimes bigger and sometimes smaller by a few milliseconds compared to the actual timestamp. But when I run my own calculated timestamp against the actual timestamp by using pythons scipy.stats.pearsonr(x,y) method, I always receive a correlation of nearly 1. I assume that‘s because these small differences in the order of millisenconds don‘t seem relevant in an hour of data. But how could I evaluate the accuracy of two timestamps a reasonable way? Are there better metrics to use than the correlation?",
    "answer": "It seems that you are trying to compute a linear statistical correlation (pearson) for something that is, by nature, a timeseries data. This will not tell you much and drawing a conclusion based on the results is dangerous.\nIt so happens that your two vectors x and y are growing linearly in the same direction which is not surprising given that they are timestamps.\nLet's take an example for stationary data and time series data:\nTime series data:\nYour sensor starts giving measurements at time t1 and continues to do so until time t2 is reached. You compute the periodic event's timestamp using your own method then compare it to the actual timestamp. However, there is no reliable way using linear statistical correlations to see if the two are related and how related are they.\nStationary data :\nNow consider the same sensor giving measurements, but now instead of computing your periodic events all at once, take a single event and compute it multiple times using your empirical data using different measurements (so forget about any notion of time at this point (i.e. repeat the measurement multiple times). The result can be averaged and an error on the mean can be computed (see info on standard error). This, now, can be compared to your single event. Based on the error, you can get a more or less feel of how good or bad your method is.\nI would recommend the following :\n\nYou have your ground truth answer (say, the periodic event) y_truth. You compute a vector of the periodic events based on your sensor and your own method mapped as a function  f(sensor_input) = y_measured\n\nNow you have two vectors, one measured and one that is ground truth. In each of those vectors, you have an indicator of a the periodic events such as an  id. I would repeat the whole set of measurements, on all  id's tens of times.\n\nFor each 'id' I would compute whatever measurement you are looking for (either a timestamp or time in seconds or whatever...) then I would subtract the two timestamps :  |y_truth - y_measured|. This is called residuals or in other words, your error.\n\nNow averging all the residuals of all the id's gives you something called mean absolute error (1/n * sum (|y_truth - y_measured|) which you can very confidently use to report how much error, in a unit of time (seconds for example), your method produces.",

    "question": "A hyperboloid has the formula\n-x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 + z^2/c^2 = 1.\nHow can I generate samples from this hyperboloid in Python? (Say, with a=b=c=1.)\nI was thinking to pick random x and y in [0,1] and then fill in the z value that would make the formula equal 1. However this would not sample uniformly. Is there a better way?",
    "answer": "This is only a partial answer.\nJ.F. Williamson, \"Random selection of points distributed on curved surfaces\", Physics in Medicine & Biology 32(10), 1987, describes a general method of choosing a uniformly random point on a parametric surface. It is an acceptance/rejection method that accepts or rejects each candidate point depending on its stretch factor (norm-of-gradient). To use this method for a parametric surface, several things have to be known about the surface, namely—\n\nx(u, v), y(u, v) and z(u, v), which are functions that generate 3-dimensional coordinates from two dimensional coordinates u and v,\n\nThe ranges of u and v,\n\ng(point), the norm of the gradient (\"stretch factor\") at each point on the surface, and\n\ngmax, the maximum value of g for the entire surface.\n\n\nThe algorithm is then:\n\nGenerate a point on the surface, xyz.\nIf g(xyz) >= RNDU01()*gmax, where RNDU01() is a uniform random number in [0, 1), accept the point. Otherwise, repeat this process.\n\nIn the case of a hyperboloid with parameters a=b=c=1:\n\nThe gradient is [2*x, -2*y, 2*z].\nThe maximum value of the gradient norm is:2*sqrt(3), if x, y, and z are all in the interval [0, 1].\n\nThe only thing left is to turn the implicit formula into a parametric equation that is a function of two-dimensional coordinates u and v. I know this algorithm works for parametric surfaces, but I don't know if it still works if we \"pick random x and y in [0,1] and then fill in the z value that would make the formula equal\" in step 1.",

    "question": "I have a list of texts. I turn each text into a token list. For example if one of the texts is 'I am studying word2vec' the respective token list will be (assuming I consider n-grams with n = 1, 2, 3) ['I', 'am', 'studying ', 'word2vec, 'I am', 'am studying', 'studying word2vec', 'I am studying', 'am studying word2vec'].\n\nIs this the right way to transform any text in order to apply most_similar()?\n\n(I could also delete n-grams that contain at least one stopword, but that's not the point of my question.)\nI call this list of lists of tokens texts. Now I build the model:\nmodel = Word2Vec(texts)\nthen, if I use\nwords = model.most_similar('term', topn=5)\n\nIs there a way to determine what kind of results i will get? For example, if term is a 1-gram then will I get a list of five 1-gram? If term is a 2-gram then will I get a list of five 2-gram?",
    "answer": "Generally, the very best way to determine \"what kinds of results\" you will get if you were to try certain things is to try those things, and observe the results you actually get.\nIn preparing text for word2vec training, it is not typical to convert an input text to the form you've shown, with a bunch of space-delimited word n-grams added. Rather, the string 'I am studying word2vec' would typically just be preprocessed/tokenized to a list of (unigram) tokens like ['I', 'am', 'studying', 'word2vec'].\nThe model will then learn one vector per single word – with no vectors for multigrams. And since it only knows such 1-word vectors, all the results its reports from .most_similar() will also be single words.\nYou can preprocess your text to combine some words into multiword entities, based on some sort of statistical or semantic understanding of the text. Very often, this process converts the runs-of-related-words to underscore-connected single tokens. For example, 'I visited New York City' might become ['I', 'visited', 'New_York_City'].\nBut any such preprocessing decisions are separate from the word2vec algorithm itself, which just considers whatever 'words' you feed it as 1:1 keys for looking-up vectors-in-training.

    "answer": "As pointed out in the comments, 1e6 rows * 4800 columns * 4 bytes per float32 is 18GiB. Writing a float to text takes ~9 bytes of text (estimating 1 for integer, 1 for decimal, 5 for mantissa and 2 for separator), which comes out to 40GiB. This takes a long time to do, since just the conversion to text itself is non-trivial, and disk I/O will be a huge bottle-neck.\nOne way to optimize this process may be to convert the entire array to text on your own terms, and write it in blocks using Python's binary I/O. I doubt that will give you too much benefit though.\nA much better solution would be to write the binary data to a file instead of text. Aside from the obvious advantages of space and speed, binary has the advantage of being searchable and not requiring transformation after loading. You know where every individual element is in the file, if you are clever, you can access portions of the file without loading the entire thing. Finally, a binary file is more likely to be highly compressible than a relatively low-entropy text file.\nDisadvantages of binary are that it is not human-readable, and not as portable as text. The latter is not a problem, since transforming into an acceptable format will be trivial. The former is likely a non-issue given the amount of data you are attempting to process anyway.\nKeep in mind that human readability is a relative term. A human can not read 40iGB of numerical data with understanding. A human can process A) a graphical representation of the data, or B) scan through relatively small portions of the data. Both cases are suitable for binary representations. Case A) is straightforward: load, transform and plot the data. This will be much faster if the data is already in a binary format that you can pass directly to the analysis and plotting routines. Case B) can be handled with something like a memory mapped file. You only ever need to load a small portion of the file, since you can't really show more than say a thousand elements on screen at one time anyway. Any reasonable modern platform should be able to keep upI/O and binary-to-text conversion associated  with a user scrolling around a table widget or similar. In fact, binary makes it easier since you know exactly where each element belongs in the file.",

Each RUN , COPY and FROM command creates a different layer. Try to combine commands in a single one using linux operators (like &&).\nA third technique is to take profit of the caching in docker image builds. Run every command you can before copying the actual content into the image. For exemple, for a python app, you might install dependencies before copying the contents of the app inside the image.",

Your features may be overly redundant and you may be using more data than you need to reach the same patterns.

For example, a model with high bias may make consistent but inaccurate predictions, while a model with high variance may make accurate predictions on average but with high variability.\n\nThe goal is to find a balance between bias and variance to achieve optimal model performance.",

I want to do the same thing for a vector function of (x1, x2), where the only roots meaningful to me lie between (0, 1) for both variables. However, the vector root finding function in scipy scipy.optimize.root does not have any way for me to specify bounds, and it doesn't seem that I can specify this as an option to any of the solver methods either.\nAre there any ways around this or other packages/functions that do what I want?

Are there ways I could hack my function to direct one of these algorithms towards the (0, 1) region?",
    "answer": "The function scipy.optimize.root_scalar has the bracket argument because when the function has a single parameter it is possible to use the bisection algorithm to find the root.\nIn higher dimensions there is no such bisection algorithm.\nNevertheless, in multiple dimensions it is possible to specify ranges in scipy.optimize.brute to limit the search space of the solution.\nTo find the root of f(x_1, ..., x_n), you can try using scipy.optimize.brute on f(x_1, ..., x_n)^2 since a root is a global minimum of the squared functions.",

In order to avoid breaking it whenever you install something that requires a higher version of numpy, for example, it is best to keep it in a separate environment.

This is an unfortunate problem which also exists in object detection architecture. The way to workaround with this is to define slightly shifted and scaled bin(or anchor) positions. This way you can detect at one pixel maximum of N objects where N is the number of anchors defined at that pixel.",

The reason is simple: there are many more negative samples that the classifer encounters in the real-time scenario (around 90 % of the time) and this does not correspond to the ideal balanced dataset I used for testing and training.\nIs there a way I can simulate this real-time case during training or are there any tricks that I can use (including pre-processing on the documents to see if they are suitable for the classifer)? \nI was planning to train my classifier using an imbalanced dataset with the same proportions as I have in real-time case but I am afraid that might bias Naive Bayes towards the negative class and lose the recall I have on the positive class.\nAny advice is appreciated.",

One is a date, and one is any value.\nFor example, in the case of a stock price increase forecast, we predict a 'single' stock.\nIf so, can you predict multiple stocks simultaneously in time series data analysis?\nFor example, after the subjects had taken medicines that affected their liver levels, they got liver count data by date so far. Based on this, I would like to experiment with predicting at which point the liver level rises or falls in the future. At this time, I need to predict several patients at the same time, not one patient. How do I specify the data set in this case?\nIs it possible to label by adding one column? Or am I not really understanding the nature of time series data analysis?\nIf anyone knows anything related, I would be really grateful if you can advise me or give me a reference site.",
    "answer": "You should do the predictions for each patient separately. You probably don't want the prediction on one of the patient to vary because of what happens to the others at the same time.\nMachine Learning is not just about giving data to a model and getting back results, you also have to think the model, what should be its input and output here. For time series, you would probably give as input what was observed on a patient in the previous days, and try to predict what will happen in the next one. For one patient, you do not need the data of the others patients, and if you give it to your model, it will try to use it and capture some noise from the training data, which is not what you want.\nHowever as you could expect similar behaviors in each patient, you can build a model for all the patients, and not one model for each patient. The typical input would be of the form :\n[X(t - k, i), X(t - k + 1, i), ..., X(t - 1, i)]\nwhere X(t, i) is the observation at time t for the patient i, to predict X(t, i). Train your model with the data of all the patients.\nAs you give a medical example, know that if you have some covariates like the weight or the gender of the patients you can include them in your model to capture their individual characteristics. In this case the input of the model to predict X(t, i) would be :\n[X(t - k, i), X(t - k + 1, i), ..., X(t - 1, i), C1(i), ..., Cp(i)]\nwhere C1(i)...Cp(i) are the covariates of the patient. If you do not have theses covariates, it is not a problem, they can just improve the results in some cases. Note that all covariates are not necessarily useful.",

It's purpose is to help the model generalize faster but sometimes it increases training times. If I am trying to replicate images, I skip BN entirely. I don't understand what you mean with regards to the accuracy. Do you mean it achieved 83% accuracy with the training data but dropped to 15% accuracy on the validation data? What was the validation accuracy without the BN? In general, the validation accuracy is the more important metric. If you have a high training accuracy and a low validation accuracy, you are indeed overfitting. If you have several convolution layers, you may want to apply BN after each. If you still over-fit, try increasing your strides and kernel size. If that doesn't work you might need to look at the data again and make sure you have enough and that it is somewhat diverse.

I recently started to learn Pandas. \nI have gone through a few tutorials and I am trying to understand what are the major improvement of Pandas over Numpy/Scipy. \nIt seems to me that the key idea of Pandas is to wrap up different numpy arrays in a Data Frame, with some utility functions around it. \nIs there something revolutionary about Pandas that I just stupidly missed?",
    "answer": "Pandas is not particularly revolutionary and does use the NumPy and SciPy ecosystem to accomplish it's goals along with some key Cython code.   It can be seen as a simpler API to the functionality with the addition of key utilities like joins and simpler group-by capability that are particularly useful for people with Table-like data or time-series.   But, while not revolutionary, Pandas does have key benefits. \nFor a while I had also perceived Pandas as just utilities on top of NumPy for those who liked the DataFrame interface.  However, I now see Pandas as providing these key features (this is not comprehensive):\n\nArray of Structures (independent-storage of disparate types instead of the contiguous storage of structured arrays in NumPy) --- this will allow faster processing in many cases.\nSimpler interfaces to common operations (file-loading, plotting, selection, and joining / aligning data) make it easy to do a lot of work in little code.\nIndex arrays which mean that operations are always aligned instead of having to keep track of alignment yourself. \nSplit-Apply-Combine is a powerful way of thinking about and implementing data-processing\n\nHowever, there are downsides to Pandas: \n\nPandas is basically a user-interface library and not particularly suited for writing library code.   The \"automatic\" features can lull you into repeatedly using them even when you don't need to and slowing down code that gets called over and over again.   \nPandas typically takes up more memory as it is generous with the creation of object arrays to solve otherwise sticky problems of things like string handling. \nIf your use-case is outside the realm of what Pandas was designed to do, it gets clunky quickly.   But, within the realms of what it was designed to do, Pandas is powerful and easy to use for quick data analysis.",

    "answer": "I don't think they will give you the exact same results as the internal implementations for 2 same operations are different even across pytorch and tensorflow.\nWhat makes Keras a better option is the ecosystem. You have the DataLoaders which can load the complex data in batches for you in the desired format, then you have the Tensorboard where you can see the model training, then you have preprocessing functions especially for data augmentations. In TF/Keras, you now even have data augmentation layers, in PyTorch Torchvision provides this in Transforms. Then you have the flexibility, you can define what types of layers in what order you want, what should be the initializer of the layer, do you want batch norm between layers or not, do you want a dropout layer between the layers or not, what should be the activation of hidden layers you can have relu in 1 layer and tanh in other, you can define how your forward pass should exist, blah blah. Then you have the callbacks to customize the training experience, and so on.",

    "question": "I have a data set of 1500 records with two classes which are imbalanced. Class 0 is 1300 records while Class 1 is 200 records, hence a ratio of ard 6.5:1.\nI built a random forest with this data set for classification. I know from past experience, if I use the whole data set, the recall is pretty low, which is probably due to the imbalanced class.\nSo I decided to undersample Class 0. My steps are as follows:\n\nRandomly split the data set into train & test set of ratio 7:3 (hence 1050 for training and 450 for test.)\nNow the train set has ~900 data of Class 0 ~100 for Class 1. I clustered ~900 data of Class 0, and undersample it (proportionally) to ~100 records.\n\nSo now train set ~100 Class 0 + ~100 Class 1 = ~200 records in total while the test set is 70 Class 0 + 380 Class 1 = 450 records in total.\nHere comes my questions:\n1) Are my steps valid? I split the train/test first and then undersample the majority class of the train set.\n2) Now my train set (~200) < test set (450). Does it make sense?\n3) The performance is still not very good. Precision is 0.34, recall is 0.72 and the f1 score is 0.46. Is there any way to improve? Should I use CV?\nMany thanks for helping!",
    "answer": "1) Are my steps valid? I split the train/test first and then\n  undersample the majority class of the train set.\n\nYou should split train and test so the class balance is preserved in both. If in your whole dataset ratio is 6.5:1 it should be the same both in train and test. \nYes, you should split it before undersampling (no need to undersample test cases), just remember to monitor multiple metrics (e.g. f1 score, recall, precision were already mentioned and you should be fine with those) as you are training on different distribution than test.\n\n2) Now my train set (~200) < test set (450). Does it make sense?\n\nYes it does. You may also go for oversampling on training dataset (e.g. minority class is repeated at random to match the number of examples from majority). In this case you have to split before as well otherwise you may spoil your test set with training samples which is even more disastrous.\n\n3) The performance is still not very good. Precision is 0.34, recall is 0.72 and the f1 score is 0.46. Is there any way to improve? Should I use CV?\n\nIt depends on specific problem, what I would do:\n\noversampling instead of undersampling - neural networks need a lot of data, you don't have many samples right now\ntry other non-DL algorithms (maybe SVM if you have a lot of features? RandomForest otherwise might be a good bet as well)\notherwise fine tune your neural network (focus especially on learning rate, use CV or related methods if you got the time) \ntry to use some pretrained neural networks if available for the task at hand",

While probability measures always assign the value 1 to the underlying set, sub-probability measures assign a value lesser than or equal to 1 to the underlying set.\n\nPairwise error probability: Pairwise error probability is the error probability that for a transmitted signal (\n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n) its corresponding but distorted version (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              X\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {X}}}\n  \n) will be received. This type of probability is called ″pair-wise error probability″ because the probability exists with a pair of signal vectors in a signal constellation.\n\nBoth concepts have their own specific applications and characteristics in their respective domains.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots to me.",
    "answer": "**Concept of Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) Plots**\n\nAccumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots are a graphical representation of the cumulative local effects of a predictor variable on a response variable. These plots are commonly used in machine learning and statistical modeling to visualize the impact of individual features on the target output.\n\n**How ALE Plots Work**\n\nALE plots are constructed by computing the local effect of a predictor variable at each data point. The local effect is calculated by taking the difference between the predicted value of the response variable with the predictor variable set to a certain value and the predicted value with the predictor variable set to a reference value (usually the mean or median).\n\nThese local effects are then accumulated across all data points, resulting in a cumulative effect for each predictor variable. The ALE plot visualizes these cumulative effects, allowing you to observe how the predictor variable influences the response variable across the entire dataset.\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose we have a model that predicts house prices based on several features, including square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. An ALE plot for the 'square footage' feature would show the cumulative effect of square footage on house prices. Each point on the plot represents the average change in house price for a given increase in square footage.\n\nBy analyzing ALE plots, we can identify which predictor variables have the strongest local effects on the response variable and how these effects vary across different data points.",

    "question": "This question is on Augmented Dickey–Fuller test implementation in statsmodels.tsa.stattools python library - adfuller().\nIn principle, AIC and BIC are supposed to compute information criterion for a set of available models and pick up the best (the one with the lowest information loss).\nBut how do they operate in the context of Augmented Dickey–Fuller?\nThe thing which I don't get: I've set maxlag=30, BIC chose lags=5 with some informational criterion. I've set maxlag=40 - BIC still chooses lags=5 but the information criterion have changed! Why in the world would information criterion for the same number of lags differ with maxlag changed?\nSometimes this leads to change of the choice of the model, when BIC switches from lags=5 to lags=4 when maxlag is changed from 20 to 30, which makes no sense as lag=4 was previously available.",
    "answer": "When we request automatic lag selection in adfulller, then the function needs to compare all models up to the given maxlag lags. For this comparison we need to use the same observations for all models. Because lagged observations enter the regressor matrix we loose observations as initial conditions corresponding to the largest lag included.\nAs a consequence autolag uses nobs - maxlags observations for all models. For calculating the test statistic for adfuller itself, we don't need model comparison anymore and we can use all observations available for the chosen lag, i.e. nobs - best_lag.\nMore general, how to treat initial conditions and different number of initial conditions is not always clear cut, autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation are largely based on using all available observations, full MLE for AR and ARMA models uses the stationary model to include the initial conditions, while conditional MLE or least squares drops them as necessary.",

    "answer": "The situation you describe is not impossible. The key is to analyse the correlation between your independent variables. If there is a strong correlation between two of them, it is possible that one of these two has a negative coefficient in your linear regression.\nFor instance, take the following example where you want to predict y using x1and x2 as independant variables :\n\nLet's say that y is deterministic and follows y = x1 + 2 * x2.\nLet's say that x2is also deterministic and that x2 = 0.1 * x1\n\nThen, your linear regression has an infinite number of possiblity, you could say that y = 1.2 * x1 + 0 * x2 as well as y = 0 * x1 + 12 * x2 or y = 2 * x1 - 8 * x2. In the latter case, although there is a positive correlation between yand x2, you have a negative coefficient in your linear regression. There is no error, nothing wrong.\nThat is why you should not jump to conclusions and say that because there is a positive slope in your linear regression model, that necessarily means that there is a positive correlation between the independent and the predicted variable. And of course, that you cannot infer any causation from your results.\nI hope that answers the question.",

While there are well known and good algorithms for unweighted selection, and some for weighted selection without replacement (such as modifications of the resevoir algorithm), I couldn't find any good algorithms for weighted selection with replacement. I also wanted to avoid the resevoir method, as I was selecting a significant fraction of the list, which is small enough to hold in memory.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on the best approach in this situation? I have my own solutions, but I'm hoping to find something more efficient, simpler, or both.",
    "answer": "The following is a description of random weighted selection of an element of a \nset (or multiset, if repeats are allowed), both with and without replacement in O(n) space \nand O(log n) time.\nIt consists of implementing a binary search tree, sorted by the elements to be \nselected, where each node of the tree contains:\n\nthe element itself (element)\nthe un-normalized weight of the element (elementweight), and\nthe sum of all the un-normalized weights of the left-child node and all of \nits children (leftbranchweight).\nthe sum of all the un-normalized weights of the right-child node and all of\nits chilren (rightbranchweight).\n\nThen we randomly select an element from the BST by descending down the tree. A \nrough description of the algorithm follows. The algorithm is given a node of\nthe tree. Then the values of leftbranchweight, rightbranchweight, \nand elementweight of node is summed, and the weights are divided by this \nsum, resulting in the values leftbranchprobability, \nrightbranchprobability, and elementprobability, respectively. Then a \nrandom number between 0 and 1 (randomnumber) is obtained.\n\nif the number is less than elementprobability,\n\n\nremove the element from the BST as normal, updating leftbranchweight\nand rightbranchweight of all the necessary nodes, and return the \nelement.\n\nelse if the number is less than (elementprobability + leftbranchweight)\n\n\nrecurse on leftchild (run the algorithm using leftchild as node)\n\nelse \n\n\nrecurse on rightchild\n\n\nWhen we finally find, using these weights, which element is to be returned, we either simply return it (with replacement) or we remove it and update relevant weights in the tree (without replacement).\nDISCLAIMER: The algorithm is rough, and a treatise on the proper implementation \nof a BST is not attempted here; rather, it is hoped that this answer will help \nthose who really need fast weighted selection without replacement (like I do).",

I get a red underline with:\n\nno module named cv2\n\nI assume that PyCharm is unable to locate my cv2.so file but I have the latest PyCharm version (4.0.6) and none of the forums I've looked at are helpful for this version. How do I get PyCharm to recognise my cv2 file? I went in Project Interpreter but there is no option for importing OpenCV from my own machine. Furthermore in Edit Configurations I defined an environment variable \n\nPYTHONPATH \n\nand set it to \n\n/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH \n\nbut this didn't help either.\nAny ideas?\nEDIT: I set up a virtualenv to no avail and figured out how to add a path to the current framework on the new PyCharm version and it turns out the path to cv2.so has already been given yet it is still complaining.",
    "answer": "Have you selected the right version of python ? \nor rather, when you have installed opencv with brew, this last probably has installed a new version of python that you can find in Cellar's Directory. You can see this immediately; from the main window of PyCharm select:\n\n\nConfigure -> Preferences -> Project Interpreter\n\n\nclick on Project Interpreter Combobox and be careful if there is a instance of python in Cellar's Directory, if yes, select it and you can see the cv2 in the list below.",

Expected 88 from C header, got 80 from PyObject\nI tried uninstalling and installing numpy 1.19.4 and 1.19.5 several times, on python 3.8 and 3.9 but the result is the same.\nRemoving TF and using latest version on numpy resolves the issue - but this isn't a solution for me.\nDidn't find anything online about this collision between the two libraries.\nWill be glad for help, thanks!",
    "answer": "I also encountered the same problem as you. I reinstalled numpy after installing TA-Lib 0.4.21 and tensorflow 2.6.0. Commands used: pip install -U numpy & pip install numpy. Now my current version of numpy is still 1.21.2, but it seems that the version collision no longer exists.",

    "answer": "Sure, here are some of the advanced techniques and strategies employed with Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) in modern machine learning applications: \n\n**1. Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)**: DBNs are a type of deep neural network that uses RBMs as building blocks. DBNs are used for a variety of tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. By stacking multiple layers of RBMs, DBNs can learn complex hierarchical representations of data.\n\n**2. Contrastive Divergence (CD)**: CD is a training algorithm for RBMs. CD is an efficient way to learn the parameters of an RBM by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from the model distribution. \n\n**3. Persistent Contrastive Divergence (PCD)**: PCD is a variant of CD that uses a persistent Markov chain. This makes PCD more efficient than CD, especially for large datasets. \n\n**4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: GANs are a type of generative model that uses an RBM as the generator. GANs are used to generate realistic-looking images, videos, and other types of data.They are trained using an adversarial process, in which a generator network competes with a discriminator network. \n\n**5. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: VAEs are a type of generative model that uses an RBM as the encoder. VAEs are used to learn a latent representation of data, which can then be used for tasks such as image compression and denoising. \n\nThese are just a few of the advanced techniques and strategies employed with RBMs. RBMs are a powerful tool for machine learning, and they are used in a wide variety of applications.",

    "answer": "**Important Considerations for Model Interpretation and Explainability**\n\n* **Understandability:** The interpretation should be clear, concise, and easy to understand by stakeholders, regardless of their technical background.\n* **Relevance:** The interpretation should provide insights that are relevant to the business problem being addressed by the model.\n* **Trustworthiness:** The interpretation should be reliable and accurate, building confidence in the model and its predictions.\n* **Actionability:** The interpretation should provide guidance on how to improve the model or make better decisions based on its predictions.\n* **Comparative Analysis of Similar Concepts**\n\nTechniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) can be used to compare the behavior of different models or different versions of the same model. This can help in understanding the impact of changes made to the model or in selecting the best model for a given task.\n* **Resource Management and Optimization**\n\nThe insights gained from model interpretation can be used to optimize the allocation of resources within complex systems. For example, by understanding the factors that drive demand for a product or service, businesses can better plan their production and inventory levels.\n* **Cross-disciplinary Applications and Synergies**\n\nModel interpretation is not limited to the field of machine learning. It has applications in diverse fields such as medicine, finance, and social sciences. By combining insights from different disciplines, it is possible to gain a more comprehensive understanding of complex systems.\n\n**Examples of Cross-disciplinary Applications**\n\n* **Medicine:** Interpreting medical models can help identify key factors that influence patient outcomes, leading to improved diagnosis and treatment.\n* **Finance:** Interpreting financial models can provide insights into the factors that drive market fluctuations, supporting better investment decisions.\n* **Social Sciences:** Interpreting models of social behavior can help understand the spread of ideas, the formation of social networks, and the emergence of collective action.",

If it is the GPU case you are really worried about, I favor the latter - it can become very annoying to try and keep everything in single precision without an extremely thorough understanding of the numpy broadcasting rules and very carefully designed code. \nAnother alternative might be to create your own methods which overload the standard numpy constructors (so numpy.zeros, numpy.ones, numpy.empty).

This section is too large to hold in memory. I would like to have a numpy style view to my slice of interest, without copying the data to memory (similar to what you could do with a numpy memmap). Is this possible? As far as I know, performing a slice using h5py, you get a numpy array in memory.\nIt has been asked why I would want to do this, since the data has to enter memory at some point anyway. My code, out of necessity, already run piecemeal over data from these cubes, pulling small bits into memory at a time. These functions are simplest if they simply iterate over the entirety of the datasets passed to them. If I could have a view to the data on disk, I simply could pass this view to these functions unchanged. If I cannot have a view, I need to write all my functions to only iterate over the slice of interest. This will add complexity to the code, and make it more likely for human error during analysis. \nIs there any way to get a view to the data on disk, without copying to memory?",
    "answer": "It is unavoidable to not copy that section of the dataset to memory.\nReason for that is simply because you are requesting the entire section, not just a small part of it.\nTherefore, it must be copied completely.\nSo, as h5py already allows you to use HDF5 datasets in the same way as NumPy arrays, you will have to change your code to only request the values in the dataset that you currently need.",

    "question": "Explain model interpretability and explainability, along with their relevance in the field of cross-disciplinary applications. Guide me with some practical tips for beginners.",
    "answer": "**Model Interpretability and Explainability**\n\nModel interpretability refers to the ability to understand how a model makes predictions. This is important for a number of reasons, including:\n\n* **Debugging:** If a model is making incorrect predictions, interpretability can help you to identify the source of the error.\n* **Communication:** Interpretable models can be more easily communicated to stakeholders, who may not have a background in machine learning.\n* **Trust:** Interpretable models can build trust in machine learning systems, since users can understand how they work.\n\nModel explainability takes interpretability one step further by providing a detailed explanation of why a model made a particular prediction. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as:\n\n* **Feature importance:** This method identifies the features that were most important in making a prediction.\n* **Decision trees:** This method creates a tree-like structure that shows the decision-making process of the model.\n* **Rule-based explanations:** This method generates a set of rules that explain how the model makes predictions.\n\n**Cross-Disciplinary Applications**\n\nInterpretable and explainable models are becoming increasingly important in a number of cross-disciplinary applications, such as:\n\n* **Healthcare:** Interpretable models can help doctors to understand the risk factors for diseases and to make better treatment decisions.\n* **Finance:** Interpretable models can help banks to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and to set interest rates.\n* **Marketing:** Interpretable models can help marketers to understand what factors influence consumer behavior and to develop more effective marketing campaigns.\n* **Resource Management and Optimization:** Models can make predictions, analyze trends, and help automate processes to optimize resource allocation and scheduling. By providing clear explanations for their predictions, model interpretability allows resource managers to make more informed decisions based on their understanding of the underlying factors influencing outcomes.\n* **Practical Tips for Beginners**\n\nIf you are a beginner in the field of model interpretability and explainability, here are a few practical tips to get you started:\n\n* **Start with a simple model.** Don't try to interpret a complex model until you have a good understanding of the basics.\n* **Use interpretable techniques.** There are a number of interpretable techniques available, such as feature importance, decision trees, and rule-based explanations.\n* **Get feedback from others.** Ask a friend or colleague to review your explanations and to provide feedback on your understanding of the model.\n* **Don't be afraid to experiment.** There is no one-size-fits-all solution to model interpretability. Experiment with different techniques and see what works best for you.",

This approximation can lead to potential regulatory and legal implications, especially in industries where compliance is essential.\n\n**Regulatory Considerations:**\n- The use of HFO should adhere to regulatory guidelines and standards applicable to your industry or domain.\n- In industries such as finance, healthcare, or autonomous systems, HFO algorithms must comply with regulations governing accuracy, reliability, and safety.\n\n**Legal Considerations:**\n- If HFO is used in decision-making processes, the accuracy and reliability of the results may be subject to legal scrutiny.\n- Proper documentation and validation of HFO algorithms are crucial to demonstrate their reliability and mitigate legal risks.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- **Accuracy and Transparency:** Ensure the HFO algorithm provides sufficiently accurate estimates of the Hessian matrix.\n- **Validation and Testing:** Conduct thorough validation and testing to assess the algorithm's performance and robustness.\n- **Documentation and Disclosure:** Clearly document the use of HFO and provide disclosures to users or stakeholders about the potential limitations and uncertainties associated with its results.\n- **Compliance with Standards:** Adhere to relevant industry standards and best practices for optimization and safety.\n- **Legal Advice:** It is advisable to consult with legal counsel to ensure compliance with specific regulatory and legal requirements applicable to your use case.",

When I click on a specific station, I want to show the destination stations to which users go to when they start from the station selected. For n stations, the data thus has a n * n format: for each station, we have the probability of going to every other station. Ideally, this probability will be the alpha of the unselected stations, such the most popular destinations would have alpha near to 1, and the less popular ones an alpha near to 0.",
    "answer": "In order to avoid tripling (or quintupling) memory usage in the browser, Bokeh only supports setting \"single values\" for non-selection colors and alphas.

So there's only two options I can think of:\n\nSplit the glyphs into different groups of glyphs, that each have a different different nonselection_color. This might be feasible if you only have a few groups. Of course now you have to partition your data to have e.g. five calls to p.circle instead of one, but it would entirely avoid JS. \nUse a tiny amount of JavaScript in a CustomJS callback. You can have an additional column in the CDS that provides the non-selected colors. When a selection happens, the CustomJS callback switches the glyph's normal color field to point to the other column and when a selection is cleared, changes it back to the \"normal\" field.",

Here are some key innovations and cutting-edge research examples:\n\n1). **Kernel Trick:** SVMs introduced the innovative kernel trick, which allows non-linearly separable data to be transformed into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable. This breakthrough significantly expanded the applicability of SVMs to complex real-world problems.\n\n2). **Maximal Margin Hyperplane:** SVMs find the optimal hyperplane that separates data points with the maximum margin, maximizing the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points (support vectors). This approach enhances the robustness and generalization能力 of SVM models.\n\n**Cutting-Edge Research Examples:**\n\n1). **Deep Kernel Learning:** Researchers are exploring deep kernel learning methods that combine deep neural networks with SVM kernels. This integration enables learning complex and hierarchical feature representations, further improving SVM performance in various applications. \n\n2). **Scalable SVM Training:** With advancements in distributed computing and optimization techniques, researchers are developing scalable SVM training algorithms that can handle massive datasets efficiently. This opens up possibilities for applying SVMs to large-scale machine learning tasks.\n\n3). **Online SVMs:** Online SVMs are being investigated for handling streaming data or scenarios where data is continuously generated. These algorithms can incrementally update SVM models as new data arrives, enabling real-time learning and decision-making.\n\nSVMs continue to inspire cutting-edge research, and their innovative concepts continue to shape the field of machine learning.",

    "answer": "Sure, here is a comprehensive overview of feature engineering using boosting algorithms for your research work: \n\n **Introduction**\n\n Feature engineering is a crucial step in machine learning, as it involves transforming raw data into features that are more informative and useful for building predictive models. Boosting algorithms are a type of ensemble learning method that can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models by combining multiple weak learners into a single strong learner. \n\n**Feature Engineering for Boosting Algorithms**\n\n When using boosting algorithms for machine learning, feature engineering plays an important role in improving the performance of the model. Here are the key steps involved in feature engineering for boosting algorithms:\n\n1). **Data preprocessing:** This step involves cleaning and preparing the data, including handling missing values and outliers. \n2). **Feature selection:** This step involves selecting the most informative and relevant features from the data. \n3). **Feature transformation:** This step involves transforming the selected features into a form that is more suitable for boosting algorithms. This may include scaling, binning, or creating new features. \n\n**Real-World Application Examples**\n\n Boosting algorithms have been successfully applied in various real-world applications, including:\n\n1). **Fraud detection:** Identifying fraudulent transactions in financial data.\n2). **Recommendation systems:** Personalizing recommendations for users based on their past behavior.\n3). **Medical diagnosis:** Predicting the risk of diseases based on patient data.\n\n**Case Studies**\n\n Here are a few case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of feature engineering for boosting algorithms:\n\n1). **Case study 1:** A study by Google showed that using feature engineering to improve the performance of a boosting algorithm for fraud detection resulted in a 20% reduction in false positives.\n2). **Case study 2:** A study by Microsoft showed that using feature engineering to improve the performance of a boosting algorithm for recommendation systems resulted in a 15% increase in click-through rates.\n\n**Innovations and Cutting-Edge Research**\n\n There are several ongoing innovations and cutting-edge research in the area of feature engineering for boosting algorithms. Some of these include:\n\n1). **Automated feature engineering:** Developing automated methods to identify and select the most informative features from data. \n2). **Transfer learning for feature engineering:** Utilizing knowledge from pre-trained models to improve the performance of feature engineering for boosting algorithms. \n3.) **New feature transformation techniques:** Developing new techniques to transform features in a way that is more suitable for boosting algorithms.\n\n **Conclusion & Recommendations for Your Research Work**\n\n Feature engineering is a crucial aspect of using boosting algorithms for machine learning. By carefully selecting and transforming the features, you can significantly improve the performance of your model. For your research work, I recommend that you explore the following areas:\n\n1). Investigate the use of automated feature engineering techniques to improve the performance of boosting algorithms. \n2). Experiment with different feature transformation techniques to identify the most effective ones for your specific dataset. \n3). Apply boosting algorithms to a real-world problem and evaluate the impact of feature engineering on the model's performance. \n\nI hope this overview provides you with a comprehensive understanding of feature engineering for boosting algorithms.

    "question": "I have used Gensim library to find the similarity between a sentence against a collection of paragraphs, a dataset of texts. I have used Cosine similarity, Soft cosine similarity and Mover measures separately. Gensim returns a list of items including docid and similarity score. For Cosine similarity and Soft cosine similarity, I guess the similarity score is the cosine between the vectors. Am I right?\nIn Gensim documents, they wrote it is the semantic relatedness, and no extra explanation. I have search a lot, but did not find any answer. Any help please",
    "answer": "Usually by 'similarity', people are seeking to find a measure semantic relatedness - but whether the particular values calculated achieve that will depend on lots of other factors, such as the sufficiency of training data & choice of other appropriate parameters.\nWithin each code context, 'similarity' has no more and no less meaning than how it's calculated right there - usually, that's 'cosine similarity between vector representations'. (When there's no other hints it means something different, 'cosine similarity' is typically a safe starting assumption.)\nBut really: the meaning of 'similarity' at each use is no more and no less than whatever that one code path's docs/source-code dictate.\n(I realize that may seem an indirect & unsatisfying answer. If there are specific uses in context in Gensim source/docs/example where the meaning is unclear, you could point those out & I might be able to clarify those more.)",

In order to multiply 1D array by matrix, the former has to be somehow promoted to either row or column vector.\nWe have 3 cases here:\n\nvector by matrix, 1D array is promoted to row vector (1xN) to make operation valid\nmatrix by vector, 1D array is promoted to column vector (Nx1)\nvector by vector, left operand is promoted to row vector, right to column vector, as in previous both cases\n\nAs result in the last case we have a normal inner product between two vectors.\nThis policy is both logical and practical because inner products are used more often.",

    "answer": "Your data – over a million texts, and perhaps tens-of-millions of words – is certainly large enough to try a default vector-size of 100 dimensions. \nPeople with smaller datasets may need to try even smaller vector-sizes, but that's getting far from the cases where Doc2Vec ('Paragraph Vectors') works well. \nBut the actual best size for your dataset & goals is something you have to find out via experimentation. (If your dataset is dominated by 5-word texts, and if your vocabulary of unique words is quite small, maybe you'll need to try lower sizes, too.) \nThere's no one answer – the variety of your texts/vocabulary, & the patterns in your data, will affect the best choice.

If methods are slightly different or data are slightly different, solutions may vary a lot.\nIf I understand correctly modern Matlab interior-point uses a crossover process (after interior-point it locates the closest basis solution), so it is much different from the classical interior-point which scipy implementation is closer to. But even if you try interior-point-legacy in Matlab it probably still will be different from the opensource interior-point used in scipy.\nBut the optimal objective value is stable. So, look at the objective value. If it is closer than your tolerance (1e-6) then you just got numerically different solutions.\nIf the objective value diverges then it may be the result of slightly different data. If you generate data in Matlab write down to file and then read it in Python you may lose accuracy.\nIf data absolutely the same then it means that one of the solvers fails to find a solution.

    "answer": "**Uncertainty quantification (UQ)** is the process of assessing the level of uncertainty in a system or model. It is used to determine the likelihood of a particular outcome or prediction. In the automotive industry, UQ is used to assess the safety and reliability of vehicles. For example, UQ can be used to determine the probability of a vehicle experiencing a crash or failing a safety test. Additionally, UQ can be used to optimize the design of vehicles by identifying areas where uncertainty can be reduced. \n\nHere are some specific examples of how UQ is used in the automotive industry: \n\n * **Crashworthiness:** UQ is used to assess the likelihood that a vehicle will experience a crash of a certain severity in real-world driving conditions. This information is used to design vehicles that are more likely to protect occupants and pedestrians.\n * **Emissions:** UQ is used to assess the uncertainty in estimates of vehicle emissions. This information is used to develop emissions regulations and to make decisions about which vehicles to purchase.\n * **Fuel economy:** UQ is used to assess the uncertainty in estimates of vehicle fuel economy. This information is used to inform consumers about the cost of owning and operating a particular vehicle.\n\nUQ is an important tool for the automotive industry as it helps to ensure the safety, reliability, and efficiency of vehicles.",

    "question": "Now introduce me to Bayesian optimization.",
    "answer": "Sure. Bayesian optimization is a sequential model-based optimization technique that is used to find the optimum of a black-box function. The term 'black-box' refers to the fact that the function is unknown and can only be evaluated at specific points. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic model of the function to guide the search for the optimum, and it iteratively updates the model as more data is collected. As a sequential optimization technique, Bayesian optimization follows an iterative process, which typically involves the following steps: \n  \n1. Initialize: Start with an initial set of points sampled from the input space. \n2. Model: Construct a probabilistic model, such as a Gaussian process, to represent the objective function based on the observed data points. \n3. Acquisition: Decide the next point to evaluate based on the expected improvement or other acquisition functions. \n4. Evaluate: Evaluate the objective function at the selected point. \n5. Update: Update the probabilistic model with the new evaluation result. \n6. Repeat: Repeat steps 2 to 5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations). \n  \nBayesian optimization has several advantages over traditional optimization methods. The primary advantage is that it requires fewer evaluations, because it uses the probabilistic model to guide the search rather than blindly searching the entire input space. Additionally, because of its probabilistic nature, Bayesian optimization provides a measure of uncertainty for its estimates. \n  \nBayesian optimization has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in various fields, such as engineering, finance, and healthcare. Some notable examples include:  \n  \n* Hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models \n* Material design and property optimization \n* Financial portfolio optimization \n* Medical treatment planning \n* Robotics control",

Novel techniques, like Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), emerged to address this challenge. \n\n- **Current Era:** Active research continues to explore cutting-edge approaches for feature importance analysis, such as explainable AI (XAI) methods that aim to provide interpretable explanations for model predictions.",

    "question": "Could you elucidate on the shortcomings and constraints of adaptive optimization algorithms, particularly in domains characterized by multimodal and dynamic landscapes?",
    "answer": "Certainly! Adaptive optimization algorithms like Adam and RMSprop have demonstrated remarkable success in various optimization tasks. However, they do have limitations, especially in multimodal and dynamic landscapes. Here's an in-depth exploration of these shortcomings and constraints:\n\n**1. Limited Exploration in Multimodal Landscapes:**\n- Adaptive optimizers rely on momentum and adaptive learning rates to accelerate convergence. In multimodal landscapes with multiple local optima, this can hinder exploration and potentially trap the optimization process in a suboptimal local minimum. They may struggle to escape local optima and discover the global optimum.\n\n**2. Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:**\n- Adaptive optimizers are sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the initial learning rate and the decay rates for momentum and adaptive learning rate adjustments. Selecting appropriate hyperparameters requires careful tuning, and suboptimal choices can lead to poor performance or even divergence.\n\n**3. Computational Overhead:**\n- Adaptive optimizers maintain additional state information, such as momentum and adaptive learning rates, which can increase the computational cost. This overhead can be significant in large-scale optimization problems or when dealing with complex models that require extensive training.\n\n**4. Limited Applicability in Non-Stationary Environments:**\n- Adaptive optimizers assume a stationary or slowly changing optimization landscape. In dynamic environments where the objective function or the data distribution changes over time, the learned adaptive parameters may become outdated and less effective.\n\n**5. Potential for Overfitting:**\n- Adaptive optimizers can be prone to overfitting, especially in situations with limited data or high-dimensional feature spaces. The adaptive learning rates may not decrease sufficiently, leading to excessive weight updates and reduced generalization performance.\n\n**6. Convergence Issues:**\n- In certain conditions, adaptive optimizers may encounter convergence issues or even diverge. This can occur due to factors such as inappropriate hyperparameter settings, numerical instabilities, or the presence of saddle points in the optimization landscape.\n\nDespite these challenges, adaptive optimization algorithms remain valuable tools for a wide range of optimization tasks. Researchers are actively exploring modifications and extensions to address these limitations, such as techniques for improved exploration, more robust hyperparameter tuning methods, and adaptive learning rate schedulers. By understanding the constraints of adaptive optimizers, practitioners can make informed choices and mitigate their potential drawbacks.",

I either get an error due to the max result size exceeding spark.driver.maxResultSize, or if I increase that limit, the driver runs out of memory.\nI am not performing any collect operation so I'm not sure why so much memory is being used on the driver.

So far it seems to be working fine, but I have a weird problem and I'm quite confident that it's not caused by my code. I've googled around and this problem seems to be quite unique, but maybe one of you guys can point me in the right direction:\nI am displaying a few steps of my lane detection algorithm in different windows (e.g. ROI, detected lines...), and every few seconds, depending on the current framerate, the image will randomly flip to being upside down in some of the windows (only one at a time and only for a single/few frames), except for the main window where I am controlling the car (manually for now). I've tried setting the Unreal Editor to different framerates, and there is definitely a connection between the output framerate (server side) and the amount of these \"flips\" happening, to the point where it's almost never happening if I run it at 15-20fps. There is also some \"tearing\" going on (e.g. only roughly the upper half of the image is flipped, like Vsynch is switched off) sometimes, which leads me to believe that the root cause is somewhere in the rendering part and not the python scripts. The point is: when the image is upside down, my lane detection is seeing the \"lane\" in the wrong place, which could lead to all sorts of trouble down the line.\nTo be honest I'm not that familiar with the whole Unreal Engine/DirectX(?)-rendering pipeline, so I am a little lost what might be causing this issue.

    "answer": "**SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)**\n\nSHAP values are a game-theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. They are based on the Shapley value from cooperative game theory, which measures the contribution of each feature to the prediction of the model. SHAP values can be used to explain both local and global model predictions.\n\n**Local Explanations:**\nSHAP values can be used to explain why a model made a particular prediction for a given input. This is done by calculating the contribution of each feature to the model's prediction. The SHAP value for a feature is the difference between the prediction of the model with that feature included and the prediction of the model with that feature excluded. \n\n**Global Explanations:**\nSHAP values can also be used to explain the overall behavior of a model. This is done by calculating the average SHAP value for each feature across all of the data in the training set.\n\n**Significance of SHAP Values**\nSHAP values are a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of machine learning models. They can be used to:\n\n- Identify the most important features in a model\n- Understand how different features interact with each other\n- Debug machine learning models\n- Communicate the results of machine learning models to non-technical stakeholders\n\n**Practical Example:**\n\nLet's say we have a machine learning model that predicts the price of houses. We can use SHAP values to explain why the model predicts a particular price for a given house. This can be done by calculating the SHAP value for each feature in the model. The SHAP value for a feature will tell us how much the feature contributed to the model's prediction.\n\n**Comparative Analysis of Similar Concepts**\n\nSHAP values are similar to other methods for explaining machine learning models, such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) and ICE (Individual Conditional Expectation) plots. However, SHAP values have several advantages over these other methods. \n\n- SHAP values are game-theoretic, which means that they are based on a solid theoretical foundation.\n- SHAP values are additive, which means that they can be used to explain both local and global model predictions.\n- SHAP values are model-agnostic, which means that they can be used to explain any type of machine learning model.",

    "answer": "**Bootstrapping**\n\n**Definition:**\nBootstrapping is a technique used in statistics and machine learning to estimate parameters of a statistical model from a dataset that is initially too small to provide reliable results. It involves repeatedly sampling from the available data, with replacement, to create a larger dataset that can then be used for analysis.\n\n**Relation to Resource Management and Optimization:**\nBootstrapping can be valuable for resource management and optimization because it allows for the efficient use of limited data. By creating multiple datasets from the same initial sample, bootstrapping can provide a more robust basis for making decisions about resource allocation and optimization.\n\n**Impact on Society and Industry:**\nBootstrapping has had a significant impact on society and industry by enabling researchers and analysts to make informed decisions with limited data. Its applications include:\n- Healthcare: Optimizing treatment protocols and predicting patient outcomes.\n- Finance: Assessing risk and making investment decisions.\n- Manufacturing: Improving quality control and optimizing production processes.\n\n**Historical Developments:**\nThe concept of bootstrapping was first proposed by Bradley Efron in 1979.

A persistent problem that bothers me is the head node and tail node. The user inputs the number of rows and the number of columns. Should I have multiple head nodes then at the beginning of each row and multiple tail nodes at the end of each row? If so, should I store the multiple head/tail nodes in a list? \nThank you.",
    "answer": "It really depends on what options you want/need to efficiently support.\nFor instance, a singly linked list with only a head pointer can be a stack (insert and remove at the head).  If you add a tail pointer you can insert at either end, but only remove at the head (stack or queue).  A doubly linked list can support insertion or deletion at either end (deque).  If you try to implement an operation that your data structure is not designed for you incur an O(N) penalty.\nSo I would start with a single pointer to the (0,0) element and then start working on the operations your instructor asks for.

I need to compare the fit of several distributions (normal, weibull, lognormal etc.).\nIs there an implementation of the Anderson-Darling in python that returns p-value and supports nonnormal distributions?",
    "answer": "I would just rank distributions by the goodness-of-fit statistic and not by p-values. We can use the Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov or similar statistic just as distance measure to rank how well different distributions fit.\nbackground:\np-values for Anderson-Darling or Kolmogorov-Smirnov depend on whether the parameters are estimated or not. In both cases the distribution is not a standard distribution.\nIn some cases we can tabulate or use a functional approximation to tabulated values. This is the case when parameters are not estimated and if the distribution is a simple location-scale family without shape parameters.\nFor distributions that have a shape parameter, the distribution of the test statistic that we need for computing the p-values depends on the parameters. That is we would have to compute different distributions or tabulated p-values for each set of parameters, which is impossible.\nThe only solution to get p-values in those cases is either by bootstrap or by simulating the test statistic for the specific parameters.\nThe technical condition is whether the test statistic is asymptotically pivotal which means that the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is independent of the specific parameters.\nUsing chisquare test on binned data requires fewer assumption, and we can compute it even when parameters are estimated.

    "question": "I am looking for a library, example or similar that allows me to loads a set of 2D projections of an object and then converts it into a 3D volume.\nFor example, I could have 6 pictures of a small toy and the program should allow me to view it as a 3D volume and eventually save it.\nThe object I need to convert is very similar to a cylinder (so the program doesn't have to 'understand' what type of object it is).",
    "answer": "There are several things you can mean, I think none of which currently exists in free software (but I may be wrong about that), and they differ in how hard they are to implement:\nFirst of all, \"a 3D volume\" is not a clear definition of what you want. There is not one way to store this information. A usual way (for computer games and animations) is to store it as a mesh with textures. Getting the textures is easy: you have the photographs. Creating the mesh can be really hard, depending on what exactly you want.\nYou say your object looks like a cylinder. If you want to just stitch your images together and paste them as a texture over a cylindrical mesh, that should be possible. If you know the angles at which the images are taken, the stitching will be even easier.\nHowever, the really cool thing that most people would want is to create any mesh, not just a cylinder, based on the stitching \"errors\" (which originate from the parallax effect, and therefore contain information about the depth of the pictures). I know Autodesk (the makers of AutoCAD) have a web-based tool for this (named 123-something), but they don't let you put it into your own program; you have to use their interface. So it's fine for getting a result, but not as a basis for a program of your own.\nOnce you have the mesh, you'll need a viewer (not view first, save later; it's the other way around). You should be able to use any 3D drawing program, for example Blender can view (and edit) many file types.",

    "answer": "You should end up seeing multicolinearity as the third dummy column is always the opposite of the sum of the first two (1 if they sum to 0, and 0 if they sum to 1).  \nThis should be removed prior to feature selection, such as RFE.\nIf you don't, statsmodel is going to throw an warning in the summary and if you check the VIF of the features post fitting, you'll see unacceptable scores that are suggesting colinear features.\nIn any case once this is done, it is feasible that one of your dummy columns could actually be a constant, such as if you had no beach houses in your data set.  The default behavior of statsmodel ignore the add_constant statement when a constant exists.

The extra CPU cores have dramatically improved the speed of fitting my models particularly for decision tree ensembles that I tend to use a lot. I am now thinking of buying additional servers from that era (early-mid 2010s) (either dual or quad-socket intel xeon E5, E7 v1/v2) and wiring them up as a small HPC cluster in my apartment. Here's what I need help deciding:\n\nIs this a bad idea? Am I better off buying a GPU (like a gtx 1080). The reason I am reluctant to go the GPU route is that I tend to rely on sklearn a lot (that's pretty much the only thing I know and use). And from what I understand model training on gpus is not currently a part of the sklearn ecosystem. All my code is written in numpy/pandas/sklearn. So, there will be a steep learning curve and backward compatibility issues. Am I wrong about this?\n\nAssuming (1) is true and CPUs are indeed better for me in the short term. How do I build the cluster and run Jupyter notebooks on it. Is it as simple as buying an additional server. Designating one of the servers as the head node. Connecting the servers through ethernet. Installing Centos / Rocks on both machines. And starting the Jupyter server with IPython Parallel (?).\n\nAssuming (2) is true, or at least partly true. What other hardware / software do I need to get? Do I need an ethernet switch? Or if I am connecting only two machines, there's no need for it? Or do I need a minimum of three machines to utilize the extra CPU cores and thus need a switch? Do I need to install Centos / Rocks? Or are there better, more modern alternatives for the software layer. For context, right now I use openSUSE on the HP server, and I am pretty much a rookie when it comes to operating systems and networking.\n\nHow homogeneous should my hardware be? Can I mix and match different frequency CPUs and memory across the machines? For example, having 1600 MHz DDR3 memory in one machine, 1333 MHz DDR3 in another? Or using 2.9 GHz E5-2600v1 and 2.6 GHz E5-2600v2 CPUs?\n\nShould I be worried about power? I.e. can I safely plug three rackmounted servers in the same power strip in my apartment? There's one outlet that I know if I plug my hairdryer in, the lights go out. So I should probably avoid that one :) Seriously, how do I run 2-3 multi-CPU machines under load and avoid tripping the circuit breaker?\n\n\nThank you.",

Whether that is the part you use, only you can say.\n\nUsing Jupiter notebooks for production is known to be a mistake.\n\nYou don't need a switch unless latency is a serious issue, it rarely is.\n\nCompletely irrelevant.\n\nFor old hardware of the sort you are considering, you will be having VERY high power bills. But worse, since you will have many not-so-new machines, the probability of some component failing at any given time is high, so unless you seek a future in computer maintenance, this is not a great idea.

    "answer": "Certainly! Permutation Importance Analysis is a valuable tool in the realm of machine learning, particularly for feature selection and variable importance estimation. Here's a detailed breakdown of how these techniques work:\n\n**Permutation Importance Analysis:**\nThis technique evaluates the importance of features by randomly permuting their values and observing the impact on the model's predictive performance. A feature with high importance will result in a significant drop in performance when its values are permuted, indicating its strong influence on the model's predictions.\n\n**Feature Selection Using Permutation Importance:**\nPermutation importance can be used to select the most informative and relevant features for your machine learning model. By ranking features based on their importance scores, you can identify those that contribute most to the model's accuracy. This helps remove redundant or irrelevant features, resulting in a more efficient and interpretable model.\n\n**Variable Importance Estimation:**\nPermutation importance also provides insights into the relative importance of different variables in your dataset. By calculating the importance score for each variable, you can understand which variables have the greatest impact on the model's predictions. This knowledge is crucial for prioritizing variables during data analysis and interpretation.\n\n**Cross-disciplinary Applications and Synergies:**\nPermutation importance analysis has found applications in various fields beyond machine learning, including:\n- **Ecology:** Identifying the key environmental factors influencing species distribution\n- **Finance:** Assessing the importance of different economic indicators in predicting stock market behavior\n- **Healthcare:** Determining the most significant factors affecting patient outcomes\n\n**Comparative Analysis of Similar Concepts:**\nPermutation importance analysis can be compared to other feature selection methods, such as:\n- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):** A sequential approach that iteratively removes features based on their importance\n- **L1 Regularization:** A technique that penalizes large coefficients, effectively reducing the impact of less important features\n\nEach method has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on factors like the dataset size, model complexity, and desired interpretability.\n\n**Impact on Society and Industry:**\nPermutation importance analysis has made significant contributions to society and industry, including:\n- **Improved Medical Diagnosis:** By identifying important variables, it aids in developing more accurate and reliable diagnostic tools\n- **Precision Agriculture:** Helps optimize crop yields by identifying key factors influencing crop growth and yield\n- **Fraud Detection:** Assists in identifying suspicious transactions by highlighting important variables that differentiate fraudulent from legitimate transactions",

    "question": "I have been struggling to understand the use of size parameter in the gensim.models.Word2Vec\nFrom the Gensim documentation, size is the dimensionality of the vector. Now, as far as my knowledge goes, word2vec creates a vector of the probability of closeness with the other words in the sentence for each word. So, suppose if my vocab size is 30 then how does it create a vector with the dimension greater than 30? Can anyone please brief me on the optimal value of Word2Vec size? \nThank you.",
    "answer": "size is, as you note, the dimensionality of the vector.\nWord2Vec needs large, varied text examples to create its 'dense' embedding vectors per word. (It's the competition between many contrasting examples during training which allows the word-vectors to move to positions that have interesting distances and spatial-relationships with each other.)\nIf you only have a vocabulary of 30 words, word2vec is unlikely an appropriate technology. And if trying to apply it, you'd want to use a vector size much lower than your vocabulary size – ideally much lower. For example, texts containing many examples of each of tens-of-thousands of words might justify 100-dimensional word-vectors.\nUsing a higher dimensionality than vocabulary size would more-or-less guarantee 'overfitting'. The training could tend toward an idiosyncratic vector for each word – essentially like a 'one-hot' encoding – that would perform better than any other encoding, because there's no cross-word interference forced by representing a larger number of words in a smaller number of dimensions. \nThat'd mean a model that does about as well as possible on the Word2Vec internal nearby-word prediction task – but then awful on other downstream tasks, because there's been no generalizable relative-relations knowledge captured. (The cross-word interference is what the algorithm needs, over many training cycles, to incrementally settle into an arrangement where similar words must be similar in learned weights, and contrasting words different.)",

    "answer": "**Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Uncovering Hidden Structures in Data**\n\nPCA is a powerful statistical technique commonly used in data analysis to reduce dimensionality and identify underlying patterns and structures in complex datasets. It transforms a set of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components (PCs). These PCs represent the directions of maximum variance in the data, making them essential for data exploration and visualization.\n\n**Revealing Hidden Structures:**\nPCA effectively reveals hidden structures by identifying linear combinations of variables that capture the most significant variations in the data. This allows you to:\n\n- **Identify clusters and patterns:** By projecting the data onto the first few PCs, you can visualize the distribution of data points and identify distinct clusters or patterns that may not be apparent from the original variables.\n- **Extract meaningful features:** PCs represent the most important features in the data, making them valuable for feature selection and extraction. This helps in reducing data dimensionality while preserving the most informative components.\n\n**Valuable Insights for Decision-Making:**\nPCA provides actionable insights for decision-making by:\n\n- **Reducing complexity:** By reducing dimensionality, PCA simplifies complex datasets, making them easier to interpret and comprehend.\n- **Improving data visualization:** PCA projections enable effective data visualization, allowing you to visually explore patterns and relationships among variables.\n- **Enhancing classification and prediction:** Reduced-dimensionality data obtained from PCA can improve the accuracy of classification and prediction models, leading to better decision-making.\n\n**Case Study: Customer Segmentation Using PCA**\nConsider a company with a large customer database. PCA can help them segment their customers based on their purchase history and demographics. By identifying the most significant PCs, they can:\n\n- **Identify different customer segments:** The PCs may reveal distinct patterns in customer behavior, highlighting groups with similar purchasing habits.\n- **Tailor marketing strategies:** Understanding the characteristics of each segment allows the company to tailor marketing campaigns specifically to their needs.\n- **Improve customer retention:** By identifying customer segments at risk of churn, the company can develop targeted retention strategies to reduce customer loss.\n\nPCA is a versatile technique with wide applications in various fields, including finance, healthcare, and image recognition. Its ability to uncover hidden structures and provide valuable insights makes it an essential tool for data-driven decision-making.",

    "answer": "The origins of quantile regression can be traced back to the work of Gauss in the 1820s, who developed a method for estimating the median of a distribution. The modern theory of quantile regression was developed in the 1970s and 1980s, with important contributions from Koenker and Bassett.",

    "answer": "The dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) is an extension of rough set theory for multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), introduced by Greco, Matarazzo and Słowiński. The main change compared to the classical rough sets is the substitution for the indiscernibility relation by a dominance relation, which permits one to deal with inconsistencies typical to consideration of criteria  and preference-ordered decision classes. Due to the preference ordering, improvement of evaluations of an object on the criteria should not worsen its class assignment.",

    "answer": "Whether you scale your target or not will change the 'meaning' of your error. For example, consider 2 different targets, one ranged [0, 100] and another one [0, 10000]. If you run models against them (with no scaling), MSE of 20 would mean different things for the two models. In the former case it will be disastrous, while in the latter case it will be pretty decent.\nSo the fact that you get lower MSE with target range [0, 1] than the original is not surprising.\nAt the same time, r2 value is independent of the range since it is calculated using variances.\nScaling allows you to compare model performance for different targets, among other things.\nAlso for some model types (like NNs) scaling would be more important.\nHope it helps!",

When I save the dataframe using df.to_csv, and open the .csv file in Excel afterwards, the scores are given as date (e.g. 1-2 is now 1st Feb).\nI realize this is an issue within Excel probably, since when I open the file in Notepad, the scores are as they should be.\nSo my question is, how best to handle it? Is there an option in Python where I can save the .csv in such a format that the score isn't converted to a date? Or is it something to be tackled in Excel?\nThanks!",
    "answer": "If you save your file as text (.txt) instead of .csv, Excel shouldn't re-format it. \nThis might go against your specific needs, if .csv is necessary. But if not, you can achieve the same result (in the sense of delimitation and headers) by opening the text file from Excel's File Menu, selecting 'Delimited'. \nThen, if in python you are saving your .txt file with a comma delimitation, de-select the 'Tab' option and select 'Comma'..",

    "answer": "There's no way of doing what you have asked for without writing your own version of permutations.\nConsider this:\n\nWe have a generator object containing the result of permutations.\nWe have written our own function to tell us the length of the generator.\nWe then pick an entries at random between the beginning of the list and the end.\n\nSince I have a generator if the random function picks an entry near the end of the list the only way to get to it will be to go through all the prior entries and either throw them away, which is bad, or store them in a list, which you have pointed out is problematic when you have a lot of options.\nAre you going to loop through every permutation or use just a few?  If it's the latter it would make more sense to generate each new permutation at random and store then ones you've seen before in a set.  If you don't use that many the overhead of having to create a new permutation each time you have a collision will be pretty low.",

    "answer": "In topological data analysis, a subdivision bifiltration is a collection of filtered simplicial complexes, typically built upon a set of data points in a metric space, that captures shape and density information about the underlying data set. The subdivision bifiltration relies on a natural filtration of the barycentric subdivision of a simplicial complex by flags of minimum dimension, which encodes density information about the metric space upon which the complex is built. The subdivision bifiltration was first introduced by Donald Sheehy in 2011 as part of his doctoral thesis (later subsumed by a conference paper in 2012) as a discrete model of the multicover bifiltration, a continuous construction whose underlying framework dates back to the 1970s.",

Here are some key aspects to consider:\n\n1. Integration with Data Science and Machine Learning: Combining attribution methods with data science techniques allows for the analysis of large and complex datasets. Machine learning algorithms can be leveraged to identify patterns and extract insights that would be difficult to obtain through traditional methods.\n\n2. Collaboration with Social Sciences: Collaborations with social sciences, such as psychology and sociology, provide valuable insights into human behavior and decision-making processes. This integration helps refine attribution models and improve their accuracy in capturing the underlying factors influencing data outcomes.\n\n3. Integration with Neuroscience: Advances in neuroscience have led to the development of neuroattribution methods that utilize brain imaging techniques to measure neural responses to marketing stimuli. This cross-disciplinary approach provides a deeper understanding of the subconscious processes that drive consumer behavior.\n\n4. Synergies with Business and Marketing: Collaboration with business and marketing professionals ensures that attribution methods are aligned with real-world business objectives. This practical perspective helps in developing attribution models that are relevant and actionable for decision-makers.\n\n5.

IIRC there is k-modes, for example, and there is k-medoids (PAM, partitioning around medoids).\nIt's unclear to me what you want to achieve overall... your data seems to be 1-dimensional, so you may want to look at the many questions here about 1-dimensional data (as the data can be sorted, it can be processed much more efficiently than multidimensional data).\nIn general, even if you projected your data into unix time (seconds since 1.1.1970), k-means will likely only return mediocre results for you. The reason is that it will try to make the three intervals have the same length.\nDo you have any reason to suspect that \"before\", \"during\" and \"after\" have the same duration? If not, don't use k-means.\nYou may however want to have a look at KDE; and plot the estimated density. Once you have understood the role of density for your task, you can start looking at appropriate algorithms (e.g. take the derivative of your density estimation, and look for the largest increase / decrease, or estimate an \"average\" level, and look for the longest above-average interval).",

    "question": "I'm a researcher studying animal behavior, and I'm trying to figure out the best way to structure my data. I present short musical tunes to animals and record their responses.\nThe Data\nEach tune consists of 1-10 notes randomly chosen from major + minor scales spanning several octaves. Each note is played for a fixed duration but played randomly within some short time window.\nI then record the animal's binary response to the tune (like / dislike).\nI play >500 tunes to the animal each day, for >300 days. I also combine data from >10 animals.\nI also need to store variables such as trial number on each day (was it the 1st tune presented? last? etc.), and date so that I know what data points to exclude due to external issues (e.g. animal stopped responding after 100 trials or for the entire day).\nThe Analysis\nI'm trying to uncover what sorts of musical structure in these randomly generated tunes will lead to likes/dislikes from the animal. I do this in a mostly hypothesis-driven manner, based on previous research. The queries I need to perform on my dataset are of the form: \"does having more notes from the same octave increase likeability of the tune?\"\nI'm also performing analysis on the dataset throughout the year as data is being accumulated.\nWhat I've tried\nI combine data from all animals into a single gigantic list containing dicts. Each dict represents a single trial and its associated:\n\nanimal ID#\nsession ID#\ntrial ID#\nbinary response (like/dislike)\ntune, which is defined by a dict. The keys are simply the notes played, and the values denote when the note is played. E.g. {'1A#':[30,100]} means a tune with just a single note, A# from 1st octave, played from 30ms to 100ms.\n\nI save this to a single pickle file. Every day after all the animals are done, I update the pickle file. I run my data analysis roughly once per week by loading the updated pickle file.\nI've been looking to re-structure my data into a database or Pandas DataFrame format because of speed of 1) serializing data and 2) querying, and 3) possible cleaner code instead of dealing with nested dicts. I initially thought that my data would naturally lend itself well to some table structure because of the trial-by-trial structure of my experiment. Unfortunately, the definition of tunes within the table seems tricky, as the tunes don't really have some fixed structure.\nWhat would be possible alternatives in structuring my data?",
    "answer": "I think that the hard part of the problem is that you'll probably want the stimulus (tune) data formatted differently for different queries. What I would think about doing is making a relatively simple data structure for your stimuli (tunes) and add a unique identifier to each unique tune. You could probably get away with using your dictionary structures here if your structure can fit into memory.\nThen I would put your trials into a relational database with the corresponding stimulus IDs. Each trial entry in the database would have complete subject and session information. \nYour for each analysis permutation you will do two steps to get the relevant data: \n\nFilter the stimuli using the stimulus data structure and get a list of their corresponding IDs. \nPreform a query on your trials database to get the trials with this list IDs. You can add other parameters to your query, obviously, to filter based on subject, session, etc.\n\nI hope that helps",

Take the norm of this (i.e. take the distance between the original 2 points), and divide (x2-x1,y2-y1,z2-z1) by that value. You now have a vector with the same slope as the line between the first 2 points, but it has magnitude one, since you normalized it (by dividing by its magnitude).

    "question": "Hey! Can you help me with contrastive loss? I'm facing difficulties in understanding how it works.",
    "answer": "Sure, I can help you with that. Contrastive loss is a type of loss function used in machine learning, particularly in tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing, where the goal is to learn representations that are discriminative and can differentiate between different classes or categories. Here's how contrastive loss works: \n\nContrastive loss aims to pull similar data points closer together(positive pair) and push dissimilar data points further apart(negative pair) in the embedding space. The loss function is defined as a function of the similarity between the embeddings of a pair of data points and the label indicating whether they belong to the same class (positive pair) or different classes (negative pair) \n\nMathematically, the contrastive loss can be formulated as follows:\n\nl(x_i, x_j, y) = 1/2 * y * (d(x_i, x_j))^2 + (1 - y) * max(0, m - d(x_i, x_j))^2\n\nwhere:\n\n* x_i and x_j represent the embeddings of two data points\n\n* y is the label indicating whether x_i and x_j belong to the same class (y = 1) or different classes (y = 0)\n\n* d(x_i, x_j) is the distance between the embeddings of x_i and x_j\n\n* m is a margin that controls the minimum distance between dissimilar data points\n\nThere are two main types of contrastive loss:\n\n**1. Siamese Contrastive Loss:** This is the original formulation of contrastive loss, where two separate networks are used, one for each input data point. The networks produce embeddings, and the distance between the embeddings is used to calculate the loss.\n\n**2. Triplet Contrastive Loss:** This formulation uses three networks, one for each input data point and one for calculating the distance. The triplet network produces embeddings for the anchor point, the positive point (from the same class), and the negative point (from a different class). The loss is calculated based on the distance between the embeddings.\n\n**Practical examples**: Contrastive loss has various applications in real-world tasks and practical scenarios. Some common use cases include:\n\n* **Face Recognition**: By learning to differentiate between different individuals, contrastive loss plays a significant role in enabling efficient and accurate face recognition systems.\n\n* **Object Detection**: Object detection models trained using contrastive loss can distinguish objects from their backgrounds, improving the precision of detection algorithms.\n\n* **Image Retrieval**: Contrastive loss is utilized to find visually similar images, which aids search engines and content-based image retrieval systems.",

CORDIC is therefore also an example of digit-by-digit algorithms.\n\nCoupling (probability): In probability theory, coupling is a proof technique that allows one to compare two unrelated random variables (distributions) X and Y by creating a random vector W whose marginal distributions correspond to X and Y respectively. The choice of W is generally not unique, and the whole idea of \"coupling\" is about making such a choice so that X and Y can be related in a particularly desirable way.\n\nBoth concepts have their own specific applications and characteristics in their respective domains.",

    "question": "Could you provide a comprehensive overview of convex optimization?",
    "answer": "Certainly! Convex optimization is a subfield of mathematical optimization that deals with problems where the objective function and the constraints are convex. Convexity is a mathematical property that ensures that the function's graph is a smooth curve without any sharp corners or sudden changes in direction. Convex optimization problems are often easier to solve than non-convex problems, and they have many applications in various fields, including engineering, economics, and finance.\n\nIn convex optimization, the goal is to find the values of the decision variables that minimize or maximize the objective function while satisfying the constraints. Common types of constraints include linear, quadratic, and inequality constraints. Convex optimization problems can be solved using a variety of algorithms, such as interior-point methods and gradient descent methods.\n\nSome important aspects of convex optimization include:\n\n- **Comparative Analysis of Similar Concepts:** Convex optimization is closely related to other optimization techniques, such as linear programming and nonlinear programming. Linear programming deals with problems where the objective function and constraints are linear, while nonlinear programming handles problems where the objective function or constraints are nonlinear. Convex optimization is a generalization of linear programming and can be used to solve a wider range of problems.\n\n- **Technical Challenges and Solutions:** Solving convex optimization problems can be challenging, especially for large-scale problems. One of the main challenges is ensuring that the problem is indeed convex. Non-convex problems can be difficult to solve and may not have a unique solution. Other challenges include dealing with constraints and handling problems with a large number of decision variables.\n\n- **Common Misconceptions and Clarifications:** A common misconception about convex optimization is that it is only applicable to small-scale problems. However, with the development of efficient algorithms and computing resources, convex optimization can now be used to solve large-scale problems with thousands or even millions of decision variables. Another misconception is that convex optimization is a new field. Convex optimization has been studied for decades and has been used to solve a wide range of practical problems.",

Chroma Features**\n\n- Represent the distribution of energy across different pitch classes.\n- Useful for music genre classification and chord recognition.\n- Advantages: Simple to compute, invariant to transpositions.\n- Disadvantages: Less effective for detecting subtle variations in pitch.\n\n**3. Constant-Q Transform (CQT)**\n\n- Divides the frequency spectrum into logarithmically spaced bands.\n- Provides high frequency resolution, enabling detailed analysis of harmonic structures.\n- Advantages: Captures musical contours well, suitable for music transcription and source separation.\n- Disadvantages: Computationally more expensive, sensitive to noise.\n\n**4. Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (GFCCs)**\n\n- Inspired by the human auditory system, using a bank of gammatone filters.\n- Simulates the frequency selectivity and temporal resolution of the cochlea.\n- Advantages: Robust to noise and distortions, captures temporal information.\n- Disadvantages: Computationally intensive, requires precise filter design.\n\n**5. Spectrogram-Based Features**\n\n- Direct representation of the power spectrum over time.\n- Provides high temporal resolution and can be analyzed using image processing techniques.\n- Advantages: Versatile, can capture both spectral and temporal information.\n- Disadvantages: Sensitive to noise, computationally expensive for large spectrograms.\n\n**6. Deep Learning Features**\n\n- Leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn complex representations directly from audio data.\n- Advantages: Can capture higher-level features, robust to noise and distortions.\n- Disadvantages: Data-hungry, requires extensive training and specialized hardware.\n\n**Choice of Method:**\n\nThe optimal method depends on the specific task and available resources. MFCCs are widely used for speech recognition, while chroma features are popular for music analysis. CQT and GFCCs are suitable for more complex tasks such as music transcription and source separation. Spectrogram-based features offer a versatile option with high temporal resolution.

I refer to class Word2Vec and HashingTF in pyspark:\nWORD2VEC: class pyspark.ml.feature.Word2Vec(*, vectorSize=100, minCount=5, numPartitions=1, stepSize=0.025, maxIter=1, seed=None, inputCol=None, outputCol=None, windowSize=5, maxSentenceLength=1000)\nHashingTF:  class pyspark.ml.feature.HashingTF(*, numFeatures=262144, binary=False, inputCol=None, outputCol=None)",
    "answer": "They're both the dimensionality of the representation, but the values will be in different ranges and useful in different ways.\nIn Word2Vec, each word gets a vector of vectorSize dimensions - where each dimension is a floating-point number (rather than a whole number). The values will be both positive and negative, and essentially never zero. Thus all words have coordinates in a fuzzy 'cloud' of space around the origin point.\nThus a word2vec vector is considered a 'dense embedding' of the word: it represents the word into a smaller vector space ('embeds' it) in a way where every dimension varies and holds some of the info ('dense'). As a result, all (100 in your example) dimensions will be used to represent any one item (word).\nIn HashingTF (which probably stands for 'hashing term frequency' or 'hashing trick frequency'), a text document of many words gets a vector of numFeatures dimensions - where each dimension is a non-negative integer count of how many times certain words appear in the document.\nBy using a technique called the 'hashing trick', it ensures any word, whether seen before or not, is assigned (by a hash value) to one of a fixed-set of counting buckets. The value of each dimension in the vector is the count of the words assigned to one bucket. In typical cases, many if not nearly-all of the buckets will be empty – and thus have zero values in the corresponding dimensions.\nThus a HashingTF vector is considered a 'sparse embedding' of a document: it represents the document into a smaller vector sapce ('embeds' it) in a way where most dimensions often stay zero, but a small relevant subset of dimensions become nonzero ('sparse'). As a result, the (262,144 in your example) dimensions might only be represented by a short list of which dimensions are non-zero and their value.",

Also is it possible to train the neural network and find the optimal inputs simultaneously? What kind of network architecture could do this?",
    "answer": "Well, a direct solution would be to apply calculus to each of the layers and solve for any local minimums or maximums (assuming that you don't have that many variables). But I don't think this solution (or similar optimization methods) would be a proper use of neural networks.\nNeural networks are designed to copy-cat. Give input X and expected output Y, optimize a function that guesses \"close\" to Y. This is the nature of a neural network. An isolated optimization problem asks a fundamentally different question. Given a body of data that approximates some underlying function, find the single \"best\" solution. Such problem is looking for a single case (or isolated discrete cases) amoungst a collection of data.\nIf you want to phrase an optimization problem in terms of a neural network solution it would look like this. Given a collection of approximated functions (millions of trained neural networks) and known optimized solutions (the expected solutions for each one), train a new neural network that mimics this behavior. This can certainly be done, but the collection of functions of interest would need some kind of bounds; it would certainly not be possible to train a single neural network that applies \"universally\" to all possible optimization problems. That would solve the entire field of optimization theory.\nFor example, given a collection of functions of the form Asin(Bx+C)+D for a random distribution of A, B, C, and D; find the maximum. Or count the number of maximum and minimum. These are great examples of something a neural network could learn to do, on unseen functions from the dataset. The neural network, might even learn the underlying behavior so well that it works with coefficients outside the initial dataset too.\nOf course, one could start building a massive collection of optimization neural networks that applies in millions of different cases for all kinds of different problems.

I.e. each call with the same dataset will yield the same split, which is not the case if you don't specify the random_state parameter.\nThe reason why I use the quotation marks, is that it is actually pseudo random.\nWikipedia explains pseudorandomness like this:\n\nA pseudorandom process is a process that appears to be random but is\n  not. Pseudorandom sequences typically exhibit statistical randomness\n  while being generated by an entirely deterministic causal process.\n  Such a process is easier to produce than a genuinely random one, and\n  has the benefit that it can be used again and again to produce exactly\n  the same numbers - useful for testing and fixing software.",

Up to now, the whole thing works in such a way that if the checking system does not know exactly whether an incoming data record is a duplicate or not, a clerk intervenes and makes the final decision. The clerk is to be \"replaced by a machine learning model\", which is to be located on a Python server, so that the clerk intervenes less in the process and becomes more and more of an \"AI trainer\". The communication between the duplicate checking system and the ML model is done by a REST API.

The second problem is that I still do not know exactly what my training data might look like from the structure. It is possible to get client data records from the client, but for various reasons this is quite unlikely. Is there a way to generate \"synthetic data\" to create an ML model?

    "answer": "**Activation Functions: A Deep Dive**\n\n**Introduction:**\nActivation functions are mathematical operations that transform the output of a neural network layer. They determine the shape and characteristics of the output distribution, influencing the network's ability to learn complex patterns.\n\n**Common Activation Functions:**\n**- Sigmoid:**\n - Formula: f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^-x)\n - Range: (0, 1)\n - Non-linear, smooth\n - Used in binary classification problems\n**- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):**\n - Formula: f(x) = max(0, x)\n - Range: (0, ∞)\n - Non-linear, piecewise linear\n - Faster to compute than sigmoid, reduces vanishing gradient problem\n**- tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent):**\n - Formula: f(x) = (e^x - e^-x) / (e^x + e^-x)\n - Range: (-1, 1)\n - Non-linear, centered around 0\n - Similar to sigmoid, but has a larger gradient near 0\n\n**Mathematical Properties:**\n- Non-linearity: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs.\n- Monotonicity: Some activation functions are monotonically increasing or decreasing, preserving the order of input values in the output.\n- Differentiability: Activation functions must be differentiable for use in backpropagation, enabling the network to adjust weights based on output errors.\n\n**Code Demonstrations in Python:**\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.array([-1, 0, 1])\n\n# Sigmoid\ny_sigmoid = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))\nprint('Sigmoid:', y_sigmoid)\n\n# ReLU\ny_relu = np.maximum(0, x)\nprint('ReLU:', y_relu)\n\n# tanh\ny_tanh = (np.exp(x) - np.exp(-x)) / (np.exp(x) + np.exp(-x))\nprint('tanh:', y_tanh)\n```\n\n**Applications:**\nActivation functions play a crucial role in various deep learning tasks:\n- Image classification\n- Natural language processing\n- Speech recognition\n\n**Latest Innovations and Cutting-Edge Research:**\n- Leaky ReLU: ReLU modified to address the 'dying ReLU' problem.\n- Swish: A smooth, non-monotonic activation function showing improved performance in many tasks.\n- Mish: A combination of sigmoid and ReLU, exhibiting better generalization capabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nActivation functions are essential components of neural networks, shaping their behavior and performance. Understanding their properties and choosing appropriate functions is crucial for successful deep learning applications.",

On a batch size of 5, data loading becomes a bottleneck in training as most of the time GPU utlization rate is 0% until data arrives.\nI have tried the following methods to increase data loading speed.\n\nUse num_parallel_calls in tf.Dataset .map API, and use multiple threads for reading this big tensor. The problem is .map wraps a py_fun which is subject to Global Interpreter Lock and thus multi-threading does not improve I/O efficiency.\nUse tf.Dataset .interleave API. Since it's also multi-threading based, it has the same problem as 2.\nUse TFRecord format. This is even slower than method 1 and 2. Possibility is TFRecord will convert tensor to numpy, then serialize numpy to bytes, then wrap this bytes to tensorflow structure and write to disk. Numpy to Tensor takes a long time for my data as measured by tf.convert_to_tensor().\n\nAny suggestions how to move forward would be helpful. Thanks!\nFollow up on comments\n\nAm I using slow disks? Data is stored on a mounted disk. Could be a reason. \nCan the data be fit into GPU memory? Unfortunately no. There are ~70,000 samples. I tried cache a small dataset into RAM and GPU utlization rate is 30%~40%, which is probably the highest expectation for this particular network.",
    "answer": "Some ideas: \n\nYou should use a combination of 1,2 and 3. If you save your files as TFRecords, you can read them in parallel, that's what they are designed for. Then, you will be able to use num_parallel_calls and interleave, because that way you don't have to wrap a py_func. \n.map doesn't have to wrap a .py_func, you could for example use tf.keras.utils.get_file. That way you also avoid using py_func and use num_parallel_calls efficiently. I still recommend using TFRecords, they are designed for this use case. \nAnother option is to use an SSD to store your data instead of a Hard Disk. \nYou can also look into the .cache function of the tf.Dataset API. Maybe you can try loading a random subset of the data, training multiple eopchs on that, and then in the mean time fetch another subset of the data (using tf.prefetch), and then train multiple epochs on that, and so on.

It learns the characteristics of the positive class and establishes a boundary around it.   \n* **Classification:** New data points are compared to the learned boundary. Data points falling within the boundary are classified as positive (belonging to the positive class), while those outside the boundary are classified as negative (outliers or anomalies). \n\n**Practical Tips for Beginners:**    \n* **Choose the right OCC algorithm:** There are various OCC algorithms available, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Select an algorithm suitable for the specific problem and data characteristics.   \n* **Tune hyperparameters:** Hyperparameters control the behavior of the algorithm. Experiment with different hyperparameter settings to optimize the classification performance.   \n* **Evaluate carefully:** Use appropriate evaluation metrics specific to OCC, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC-ROC) or the F1 score. \n\n**Additional Considerations:**   \nIn OCC, it's important to note that:   \n* The algorithm learns the positive class characteristics, but it may not explicitly learn the negative class.   \n* The efficacy of OCC depends heavily on the representativeness and quality of the positive class dataset used for training.  \n* OCC is suitable for scenarios where obtaining negative data is challenging or costly.",

    "answer": "Selecting the number of trees in gradient boosting models can be done through default settings or hyperparameter tuning. Most implementations default to a relatively small number of trees, but for optimal performance, a grid search with cross-validation can be conducted. By systematically evaluating different values for the number of trees and selecting the one that maximizes model performance metrics, such as accuracy or F1 score, the optimal number of trees can be determined, ensuring robustness and effectiveness of the gradient boosting model.",

Teacher-Student Model Setup:**\n- Define the teacher model (pre-trained, high-capacity model) and student model (smaller, less complex model).\n**2. Soft Target Generation:**\n- The teacher model makes predictions on the training data to generate soft targets (probabilistic distributions over labels).\n**3. Distillation Loss Calculation:**\n- A loss function (e.g., Kullback-Leibler divergence, mean squared error) is used to measure the difference between the student model's predictions and the soft targets.\n**4. Optimization and Training:**\n- The student model is trained to minimize the distillation loss while simultaneously optimizing the task loss.\n**5. Knowledge Transfer:**\n- The student model's knowledge gradually improves as it learns to match the predictions of the teacher model.\n\n**Variations of Knowledge Distillation:**\n\n- **Temperature Distillation:** Softens the teacher predictions by increasing the temperature parameter, allowing the student model to learn a broader range of knowledge.\n- **Label Smoothing:** Adds noise to the true labels, forcing the student model to make less confident predictions and encouraging knowledge transfer.\n- **Instance-Specific Distillation:** Tailors the distillation process for each training instance, focusing on harder examples or instances where the teacher and student models disagree.\n- **Multi-Stage Distillation:** Utilizes multiple teacher models of varying complexity, with each student model learning from a different teacher at different stages.",

    "answer": "**Capabilities and Limitations of Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs):**\n\n**Capabilities:**\n\n- **Efficient handling of long-term dependencies:** GRUs excel at capturing temporal relationships in sequential data, allowing them to model long-term dependencies more effectively than traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\n- **Reduced vanishing and exploding gradient problems:** GRUs' gating mechanism helps mitigate the vanishing and exploding gradient problems that plague traditional RNNs, resulting in more stable training.\n- **Fewer parameters than LSTMs:** GRUs have a simpler architecture compared to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, with fewer parameters, making them more efficient for training on smaller datasets.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n- **Limited expressiveness:** GRUs are less expressive than LSTMs, as they lack an explicit memory cell to store long-term information. This can limit their ability to model complex temporal relationships.\n- **Potential for overfitting:** In some cases, GRUs may be prone to overfitting on smaller datasets due to their simplified architecture.\n\n**Advantages and Disadvantages Compared to Other Recurrent Neural Network Architectures:**\n\n**Advantages of GRUs over LSTMs:**\n\n- **Faster training time:** GRUs require less training time than LSTMs due to their simpler architecture and fewer parameters.\n- **Lower computational cost:** GRUs are less computationally expensive than LSTMs, making them suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.\n- **Effective for smaller datasets:** GRUs often perform well on smaller datasets where LSTMs may overfit.\n\n**Advantages of LSTMs over GRUs:**\n\n- **Higher expressive power:** LSTMs have a more powerful architecture that can capture more complex temporal relationships and model long-term dependencies more effectively.\n- **Suitable for complex tasks:** LSTMs are better suited for tasks that require modeling intricate sequential data, such as natural language processing and speech recognition.\n- **More stable for long sequences:** LSTMs are more stable when processing very long sequences compared to GRUs.\n\nUltimately, the choice between GRUs and LSTMs depends on the specific task and dataset at hand. GRUs are a good choice for tasks where efficiency and speed are critical, while LSTMs are more suitable for complex tasks that require a higher level of expressiveness.",

    "answer": "The Rubin causal model (RCM), also known as the Neyman–Rubin causal model, is an approach to the statistical analysis of cause and effect based on the framework of potential outcomes, named after Donald Rubin. The name \"Rubin causal model\" was first coined by Paul W. The potential outcomes framework was first proposed by Jerzy Neyman in his 1923 Master's thesis, though he discussed it only in the context of completely randomized experiments.",

    "question": "The context is : I already have clusters of words (phrases actually) resulting from kmeans applied to internet search queries and using common urls in the results of the search engine as a distance (co-occurrence of urls rather than words if I simplify a lot).\nI would like to automatically label the clusters using semantics, in other words I'd like to extract the main concept surrounding a group of phrases considered together. \nFor example - sorry for the subject of my example - if I have the following bunch of queries : ['my husband attacked me','he was arrested by the police','the trial is still going on','my husband can go to jail for harrassing me ?','free lawyer']\nMy study deals with domestic violence, but clearly this cluster is focused on the legal aspect of the problem so the label could be \"legal\" for example.\nI am new to NPL but I have to precise that I don't want to extract words using POS tagging (or at least this is not the expected final outcome but maybe a necessary preliminary step).\nI read about Wordnet for sense desambiguation and I think that might be a good track, but I don't want to calculate similarity between two queries (since the clusters are the input) nor obtain the definition of one selected word thanks to the context provided by the whole bunch of words (which word to select in this case ?). I want to use the whole bunch of words to provide a context (maybe using synsets or categorization with the xml structure of the wordnet) and then summarize the context in one or few words.\nAny ideas ? I can use R or python, I read a little about nltk but I don't find a way to use it in my context.",
    "answer": "Your best bet is probably is to label the clusters manually, especially if there are few of them. This a difficult problem even for humans to solve, because you might need a domain expert. Anyone claiming they could do that automatically and reliably (except in some very limited domains) is probably running a startup and trying to get your business.\nAlso, going through the clusters yourself will have benefits. 1) you may discover you had the wrong number of clusters (k parameter) or that there was too much junk in the input to begin with. 2) you will gain qualitative insight into what is being talked about and what topic there are in the data (which you probably can't know before looking at the data). Therefore, label manually if qualitative insight is what you are after. If you need quantitative result too, you could then train a classifier on the manually labelled topics to 1) predict topics for the rest of the clusters, or 2) for future use, if you repeat the clustering, get new data, ...",

Another approach could be to generate the modelDescription.xml and parse it, I assume the information is available somewhere in there, but for that approach I also feel I need help to get started.",
    "answer": "The files dsin.txt and dsfinal.txt might help you around with this. They have the same structure, with values at the start and at the end of the simulation; by renaming dsfinal.txt to dsin.txt you can start your simulation from the (e.g. steady-state) values you computed in a previous run.  \n\nIt might be worthy working with these two files if you have in mind already to use such values for running other simulations.\nThey give you information about solvers/simulation settings, that you won't find in the .mat result files (if they're of any interest for your case)\n\nHowever, if it is only a comparison between start and final values of variables that are present in the result files anyway, a better choice might be to use python and a library to read the result.mat file (dymat, modelicares, etc). It is then a matter of comparing start-end values of the signals of interest.",

    "answer": "Progressively measurable process: In mathematics, progressive measurability is a property in the theory of stochastic processes. A progressively measurable process, while defined quite technically, is important because it implies the stopped process is measurable.\n\nDecision tree pruning: Pruning is a data compression technique in machine learning and search algorithms that reduces the size of decision trees by removing sections of the tree that are non-critical and redundant to classify instances. Pruning reduces the complexity of the final classifier, and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting.\n\nBoth concepts have their own specific applications and characteristics in their respective domains.",

    "answer": "Firstly, all lines in 3d correspond to an equation; secondly, all lines in 3d that lie on a particular plane for part of their length correspond to equations that belong to a set of linear equations that share certain features, which you would need to determine. The first thing you should do is identify the four corners of the supposed plane - they will have x, y or z values more extreme than the other points. Then check that the lines between the corners have equations in the set - three points in 3d always define a plane, four points may not. Then you should 'plot' the points of two parallel sides using the appropriate linear equations. All the other points in the supposed plane will be 'on' lines (whose equations are also in the set) that are perpendicular between the two parallel sides. The two end points of a perpendicular line on the sides will define each equation. The crucial thing to remember when determining whether a point is 'on' a line is that it may not be, even if the supposed plane was inputted as a plane. This is because x, y and z values as generated by an equation will be rounded so as correspond to 'real' points as defined by the resolution that the graphics program allows. Therefore you must allow for a (very small) discrepancy between where a point 'should be' and where it actually is - this may be just one pixel (or whatever unit of resolution is being used). To look at it another way - a point may be on a perpendicular between two sides but not on a perpendicular between the other two solely because of a rounding error with one of the two equations. If you want to test for a 'bumpy' plane, for whatever reason, just increase the discrepancy allowed. If you post a carefully worded question about the set of equations for the lines in a plane on math.stackexchange.com someone may know more about it.",

In the early days, data was often stored in flat files, and transformations were performed manually or with simple tools. As the volume and complexity of data grew, data transformation became more challenging. This led to the development of specialized data transformation tools and techniques.\n\n**Future Trends**\n\nThe future of data transformation is bright. There are a number of emerging trends that will make data transformation easier, faster, and more efficient. These trends include:\n\n* The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to automate data transformation tasks\n* The development of data transformation tools that are cloud-based and serverless\n* The increasing adoption of data transformation as a service (DTaaS)\n\n**Regulatory and Legal Implications**\n\nData transformation can have regulatory and legal implications. This ranges from US and International Laws.  It is important to be aware of these implications when carrying out data transformation projects.\n\n**Resource Management and Optimization**\n\nResource management and optimization is a key consideration in data transformation pipelines. Data transformation can be a resource-intensive process, and it is important to ensure that resources are used efficiently. This can be done by using efficient algorithms, data structures, and hardware.\n\n**Interplay with Other Technologies**\n\nData transformation is closely related to other technologies, such as data integration, data quality management, and data governance. Data integration is the process of combining data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. Data quality management is the process of ensuring that data is accurate, complete, consistent, and timely. Data governance is the process of managing the use of data within an organization.\n\nThese technologies are all part of the data management landscape, and they work together to ensure that data is properly managed and transformed to meet the needs of the business.",

    "answer": "The cross-entropy (CE) method is a Monte Carlo method for importance sampling and optimization. It is applicable to both combinatorial and continuous problems, with either a static or noisy objective. The method approximates the optimal importance sampling estimator by repeating two phases:\n\nDraw a sample from a probability distribution.",

    "answer": "In probability and statistics, decoupling is a reduction of a sample statistic to an average of the statistic evaluated on several independent sequences of the random variable. This sum, conditioned on all but one of the independent sequences, becomes a sum of independent random variables.",

    "answer": "The Jenkins–Traub algorithm for polynomial zeros is a fast globally convergent iterative polynomial root-finding method published in 1970 by Michael A. They gave two variants, one for general polynomials with complex coefficients, commonly known as the \"CPOLY\" algorithm, and a more complicated variant for the special case of polynomials with real coefficients, commonly known as the \"RPOLY\" algorithm.",
